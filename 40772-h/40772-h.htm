<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>From the abundant records and traditions dealing with
the curious belief that certain men and women can
transform themselves into animals I have collected a
number of instances and examples which throw fresh
light on the subject both from the point of view of
folk-lore and occultism. The causes of transformation
are various: contact with a wer-animal, touching what
he has touched, wearing an animal skin, rubbing the body
with ointment, slipping on a girdle, buckling on a strap,
and many other expedients, magical and otherwise, may
bring about the metamorphosis. Removing the skin,
burning it, or piercing it with the stab of a knife, or the
shot from a gun, so that blood is drawn, are among the
best-known methods for causing the human shape to be
resumed, but the stab should be on the brow or between
the eyes, and the bullet should be made of silver and is
all the better for having been blessed in a chapel of St.
Hubert, otherwise the attempt to break the enchantment
may fail. The penalty for being a wer-animal is death,
but sentence is not passed until after some ordeal has
been gone through, such as dipping the finger into
boiling resin, innocence being established if the finger be
drawn out unhurt. Any wound inflicted on the transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
animal is simultaneously inflicted on the human
body, and in many other characteristics the nature
of the wer-animal is similar to that of the witch or
wizard.</p>

<p>In "Balder the Beautiful" Dr. J. G. Frazer, after
telling many typical stories, endeavours to establish a
parallelism between witches and wer-animals, the analogy
appearing to confirm the view that the reason for burning
a bewitched animal alive is a belief that the human being
is in the animal, and that by burning you compel him to
assume another shape. Since the sum of energy in the
universe is held to be constant and invariable, the chain
of transformation is thus continued, and form follows
form, endlessly linked together. By some such theory
the phenomena of life and death may be explained and
the doctrine of immortality, usually applied only to the
soul of man, can be reasonably extended to animals.</p>

<p>The belief that human and animal souls possess power
and entity when externalised and apart from the living
body is less widely held than that of persistence after
death. It is one that bears strongly on the subject of
animal transformation, as well as on the affinity which
certain animals possess for some families, an affinity that
is akin to totemism.</p>

<p>These preliminary suggestions will enable readers to
grasp the scope of my book, which is intended to provide
a comprehensive view of the subject and to familiarise
them with the nature of the phenomena, even though it
has been well-nigh impossible to classify and tabulate
them fully, or to explain them satisfactorily.</p>

<h1>HUMAN ANIMALS<br />
<br />
<br /></h1>
<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p>The belief that men can change into animals and
animals into men is as old as life itself. It originates
in the theory that all things are created from one substance,
mind or spirit, which according to accident or
design takes a distinctive appearance, to mortal eye, of
shape, colour, and solidity. Transformation from one
form to another then becomes a thinkable proposition,
especially if it be admitted that plastic thought in the
spirit world takes on changed forms and conditions
more readily than in the world of matter. The belief of
primitive races that all created beings have an immortal
soul dwelling in a material body applies equally to the
brute creation and to the human race. "In the beginning
of things," says Leland, "men were as animals
and animals as men."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The savage endows brutes with
similar intelligence and emotions to his own. He does
not distinguish between the essential nature of man, of
various beasts, and even of inanimate objects, except
where outward form is concerned; and he senses, even
more clearly than his civilised brother, the psychic
bonds which unite man and the animals. Folk-lore
abounds in incidents which are based on the impermanence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of form and which tell of people changing into
animals or animals changing into human beings.</p>

<p>The scientific problems of to-day which deal with the
theory of breaking up matter into electrons may quite
possibly have a bearing on this subject and may not be
so far removed, as appears at first sight to be the case,
from the intuitive beliefs of the savage.</p>

<p>Transformation was held to be accomplished in various
ways, a sorcerer, a witch or the evil one himself being
the agent through whom the change was effected.
Certain people have had ascribed to them the power of
self-transformation, a curious psychical gift which to
this day appeals to imaginative people, and which may
be regarded as a projection of mind in animal form.</p>

<p>Changes may be voluntary or involuntary, self-transformation
belonging more frequently to the former
class and transformation by sorcery, witchcraft or black
magic more often to the latter class. The motives of a
human being who wishes to change into an animal are
naturally regarded with suspicion. Greed, cruelty, and
cannibalism are accusations brought against those who
were tried in the Middle Ages for the crime of lycanthropy,
the transformation into a wolf or other wild
beast. The desire to taste human flesh is a horrible
but not improbable reason for the offence. The wish
to inspire fear or to gain personal power over others
are motives for impersonating wild and fearsome animals,
as effective where superstitious people are concerned as
the less common faculty of transforming actual flesh.</p>

<p>Savage races do not necessarily connect the idea of
transformation with any thought of evil. They find
the plan of impersonating an animal in its lair, for the
sake of safety, say, extremely useful. They have also
the best of reasons for developing a special attribute,
such as the keen scent of the hound, the long sight of
the eagle, the natural protective power against cold
possessed by the wolf and so forth, imitative suggestion
which occurs in many of their primitive customs. Thus
the Cherokee Indian when starting on a winter's journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
endeavours by singing and other mimetic action to
identify himself with the wolf, the fox, the opossum or
other wild animal, of which the feet are regarded by
him as impervious to frost-bite. The words he chants
mean, "I become a real wolf, a real deer, a real fox, and
a real opossum."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Then he gives a long howl to imitate
the wolf or barks like a fox and paws and scratches the
ground. Thus he establishes a belief in transformation
by sympathetic or hom&#339;opathic magic, and starts forth
on his difficult journey in perfect confidence, the power
of auto-suggestion aiding him on his way. Such customs
are closely allied with the superstitions of the dark ages,
when it was assumed without question that bodily transformation
took place.</p>

<p>Involuntary change into animal shape was thought to
occur as a punishment for crime, and was looked upon
as a judgment of the gods. Few beliefs are more common
among savages than that reincarnation in a lower form
is the result of sin in a previous existence. Bats especially
are held to be the abode of the souls of the dead, and to
some races they are sacrosanct for this reason. Most
animals have been looked upon as a possible receptacle
of man's soul, and many primitive tribes believe that
man can choose in which animal body he prefers to
dwell. In the Solomon Islands, for instance, a dying
man informs the members of his family in what sort of
animal shape he expects to live again. One among
hundreds of similar superstitions is that if a cat jumps
over a corpse, the soul of the deceased enters its body.</p>

<p>Murder of what is holy, and the offering of human
sacrifices are two offences punishable by transformation,
but once transformed, the soul-animal wins respect rather
than contempt, and care is taken that no injury shall
befall it, lest a relative or friend should suffer. A savage
avoids harming his own family animal, but does not
hesitate to kill the soul-animal into which a member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
a hostile tribe has entered. Should such an animal die,
the soul is thought by many races to pass into another
body of the same type, but other tribes, especially in
Madagascar, believe that the death of the animal releases
the human soul that had lodged within it.</p>

<p>A more original idea is that certain human beings
possess animal doubles and that the soul-animal roams at
large while the man remains visible in his ordinary form,
and many of the vampire and wer-wolf stories are
traceable to this belief. The Toradjas of Central Celebes
believe that the inside parts only of the man take on the
animal shape, a state which they term <i>lamboyo</i>. The
<i>lamboyo</i> may be distinguished from an ordinary animal
by being misshapen to some extent, for instance, a buffalo
may have only one horn, or a dog may have a pig's snout.
The <i>lamboyo</i>, like the vampire, has a preference for
human victims, whom he grievously tortures and maims.</p>

<p>Far more beautiful is the myth of <i>tanoana</i>, the divine
essence in man which goes forth from his body, as in
sleep, and, being of the same nature as the soul of the
animal, allows of interchange to take place between the
human and the animal bodies.</p>

<p>Even amongst the most practical and enlightened
people of to-day psychic experiences in which animals
have played a part are of common enough occurrence,
and a survey of the grounds on which man and animal
shapes and spirits meet may help them to understand
things which, to our limited human intelligence, appear
at least strange, if not altogether inexplicable.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION</h3>


<p>How did man come to change into an animal? Folklore
and superstition describe a number of ways. The
most common method appears to have been the wearing
of the skin of the animal in question. One drew it over
one's shoulders, mask and all, and awaited results. These
were not always satisfactory, and if any delay occurred
it was better to strip off the clothes, rub the limbs with
a potent ointment and murmur a long incantation.
Such things, if we may believe tradition, invariably did
the trick. But there were many other ways of bringing
about the desired state. According to Grimm,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> transformation
could be effected by tying a strap of human
skin round the body; others say the skin must be a
girdle made from the animal's hide.... It also sufficed
to shift the buckle of a certain strap to the ninth hole.
To drink water out of the footprint made by the animal,
to partake of its brains, to drink from certain enchanted
streams, to haunt the lair of a wer-wolf, to eat his food
or come into personal contact with him or his belongings
were all means of voluntary or involuntary transformation
which, according to its nature, might be permanent
or merely transitory. Livonian wer-wolves were initiated
by drinking a cup of beer of a special character accompanied
by a particular incantation. Other countries had
magical procedure which differed in detail, if not in the
main features. As a rule the devil was supposed to have
had a hand in the transformation process, and one man
accused of the crime declared that a female devil had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
presented him with a belt and whenever he buckled it
he was changed into a wolf spontaneously. This gentleman,
when he was back in human shape, was always
heard to remark in surprise that he had not the faintest
idea where the bristles went which had adorned him
when in wolfish form.</p>

<p>A return to human body was sometimes easy, sometimes
extremely difficult. The girdle or skin being
removed was often sufficient to remove the enchantment
too. Plunging into water or rolling over and over in
dew were said to be equally efficacious. A considerably
slower method was to kneel in one spot for a hundred
years, long enough, one would imagine to deter anyone
from ill-judged ambitions to prowl around the world in
animal shape. Other cures, however, were simpler, such
as being saluted with the sign of the cross, or to be called
three times loudly by the baptismal name, or to be
struck three blows on the forehead by a knife, or to have
three drops of blood drawn from some part of the body.
In many cases one other person besides the transformed
man was in possession of certain formulæ necessary for
restoring him to a normal appearance, and if by any
accident this person was killed or otherwise removed
from the sphere of action, woe betide him in animal
shape, for he probably had to retain it during the rest
of his natural existence.</p>

<p>There is a legend in Lorraine that if stalks of grass are
pulled up, blessed and thrown against a tree, wolves
spring forth, being transformed from the men who
threw the grass. To become a she-bear it is only necessary
to put a slip of wood into one's mouth; when the
wood is taken out human shape returns.</p>

<p>Another myth, mentioned by Grimm, is that at certain
times of night wer-wolves turn into three-legged
dogs and can only be freed by someone crying out "wer-wolf."</p>

<p>Seven and nine are important numbers in transformation.
When seven girls are born of one marriage, one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
thought to turn into a wer-wolf and the seventh child
of the seventh child is predestined to the same fate. The
spell is said to last nine days. Anyone who puts on a
wolf-shirt is transformed into a wolf for this period and
returns to human shape on the tenth day. Grimm says
the seal is supposed to doff his fishy skin every ninth
day and for one day become a man, and there is a
common saying that a cat twenty years old turns into a
witch, and a witch of a hundred turns back into a cat.</p>

<p>Having taken the body of a beast, man becomes known as
a wer-animal, wer being probably derived from the Latin
<i>vir</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He then assumes the characteristics of the natural
animal, with additional strength, agility, and ferocity.</p>

<p>In mediæval times powers of transformation seem to
have been sought after and were even regarded as a
privilege. Although often acquired for evil purposes,
among primitive peoples to change into an animal did
not necessarily imply a descent in the scale of being. To
them there is but a slight line of demarcation between the
animal world and mankind. They are not influenced so
much by the idea of human degradation as by a beautiful
belief in the brotherhood and fellowship of all creation.</p>

<p>Lycanthropy is the technical name for the pathological
condition of a man who believes he has become an animal.
The word means literally wolf-man, the wolf being
chosen as the most dangerous animal known in European
countries, though the tiger, hyæna, or any other wild
animal serves the purpose equally well.</p>

<p>The symptoms exhibited by the wer-animal are at
first extreme restlessness and anxiety. He develops,
sometimes instantaneously, sometimes by degrees, the
instincts of the kind of creature into which he has been
transformed, often acquiring enormous strength and the
special characteristics of the animal. If it be carnivorous
by nature he has a lust to kill, and he can do what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
animal does as well as what he was naturally capable of
doing. His body is in the shape of an animal, but his
eyes, according to some accounts, remain unchanged,
and the human being looks out of these windows of his
soul. His intelligence will probably, however, be darkened
by the shadow of malignity or passion usual to the
lower creation.</p>

<p>As early as 1579, Wierius described lycanthropia as a
disease, and declared the Arabs called it <i>Chatrap</i>, after an
animal. Another name was <i>Tipule</i>. (Latin race.) The
victims had sunken eyes and could not see well, the tongue
was dry and they were thirsty, the saliva being dried up.
To cure them they had to be well-fed, much bathed,
and given drugs which were used in melancholic diseases.
Before an attack the head was rubbed with soporific
herbs, opium was applied to the nose and the patient was
dosed with a narcotic.</p>

<p>When under the delusion that he is changed into a
wolf the wer-animal gives vent to a long howl and starts
off with a rush to the nearest forest, where he prowls
about through the night seeking his victims. These he
kills in the ordinary manner of a wild beast, tearing
asunder their limbs and feasting on their flesh. In some
countries his method is more elaborate and it is supposed
that the wer-wolf, having chosen his victim, exerts certain
occult powers to numb his faculties and, cutting up
the body, extracts the liver, which he eats and then joins
the parts of the body together again so that the friends
of the dead man know not how he came to lose his life.</p>

<p>Having satisfied his thirst for blood, the man-wolf, at
the wane of his madness, once more seeks human shape,
and then it is probable that he suffers for his abnormal
appetites. Reaction leaves him weak and debilitated,
with dry throat and tongue, feeble vision, hollow and
discoloured cheeks, and sore places where he was hurt
by his victim struggling for life.</p>

<p>Some subjects of lycanthropia, or imitative madness,
endure still greater horrors, and the case of a patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
who trembled with terror at his own condition is quoted
by M. Morel in his "Études Cliniques."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "See this
mouth," he cried, touching his lips with his fingers, "it
is the mouth of a wolf, and see the long hairs which cover
my body and my paws. Let me bound away into the
woods so you may shoot me there!" When his family
endeavoured to caress him, he cried out that they were
embracing a wolf. He asked for raw meat, the only
food he could touch, but on tearing it apart he found
it not to his liking as it had not been freshly killed.
Thus he went through the tortures of the damned until
released by death.</p>

<p>Another victim of the disease is mentioned by Fincelius
in his second Book of Wonders. He says that "at Padua
in the year 1541 a certain husbandman did seem to himself
wolf, and did leap upon many in the fields, and did
kill them. And that at last he was taken not without
much difficulty, and did confidently affirm that he was a
true wolf, only that the difference was in the <i>skin turned
in with the hairs</i>. And therefore that, having put off all
humanity and being truly truculent and voracious, he
did smite and cut off his legs and arms, thereby to try
the truth of the matter, but the innocency of the man
being known, they committed him to the chirurgeon's
to be cured, but that he died not many days after. Which
instance is sufficient to overthrow the vain opinion of
those men that believe that a man or woman may be
really transubstantiated into a wolf, dog, cat, squirrel
or the like without the operation of an omnipotent
power."</p>

<p>In spite of the unpleasant consequences with which
lycanthropy seems to be connected there is little doubt
that transformation used to be regarded as a useful and
sometimes even profitable relaxation. Those who were
already initiated into its mysteries were generally willing
to help others to obtain proficiency, and a draught from
the hand of an expert was considered enough to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the desired condition in the novice.</p>

<p>Predestination to become a wer-animal is thought to
be distinguished by some peculiarity in the appearance,
such as the meeting of the eyebrows, and the tendency
to transform is believed to wax and wane with the seasons
and to be subject to the influence of the moon.</p>

<p>The head, claws, and hairy skin of a wer-wolf are like
those of a real wolf, but the great test of identity lies in
his lack of tail, and in his clothes, which are sure to be
found not far from the scene of slaughter.</p>

<p>When doubt is felt whether a wer-wolf is a human
being or a real wolf, steel or iron is thrown at the animal
under suspicion. When this is done to a genuine wer-wolf
the skin is said to split crosswise on the forehead and
the naked man comes out through the opening. Sometimes
the wer-wolf is frozen with the cold and then he
is invulnerable to ordinary weapons. The only way to
wound him is to shoot at him with balls of elder pith or
bullets of inherited silver.</p>

<p>When the victim is attacked by a human animal the
injured person's clothes are stripped from his body.
The genuine animal tears them in shreds. If the wer-animal
has been transformed by means of a strap of
human skin, his tail is then certain to be truncated.</p>

<p>In the following Hessian folk-story, which concerns a
poverty-stricken married couple, a large ring was used
to bring about the metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The wife always contrived to have meat for every
meal and the husband never knew how she managed it.
After much questioning she agreed to tell him, and
taking him to a field where sheep were grazing she threw
a ring over herself and became a wer-wolf. She seized
one sheep and was running off with it when the man,
who had promised not to call her by name during the
performance, cried out, "Oh, Margaret!" and as he
did so the wolf disappeared and the woman stood there
with no clothes on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>A very similar story is told of a nobleman who fell
short of food while traversing a wide tract of country
in Russia with a party of friends. He transformed himself
into a wolf and caught several sheep, which provided
an excellent meal for the travellers.</p>

<p>In India a story is current that there was once a man
who was able to change himself into a tiger, but who
found it very difficult to resume his normal shape. When
he wished to become human again, it was necessary for
a particular friend of his to cite a certain formula. The
friend died and as this catastrophe limited the tiger-man's
powers he determined to teach the proper formula
to his wife.</p>

<p>A few days later, having enjoyed a glorious hunt and
devoured several antelopes, he trotted up to his wife in
the disguise of a tiger, hoping she would not forget how
to work the spell. When she saw the dangerous monster
approaching her she began to scream. The animal
jumped round about her, trying to remind her by dumb
show of what she had to do, but the greater efforts he
made the more frightened she grew and the louder
became her cries. So annoyed was the man-tiger by her
aggravating stupidity that he thought, "This is the most
irritating woman I ever saw," and, flying into a terrible
passion, he attacked and slew her. Then to his regret he
remembered that no other human being knew the incantation
necessary for his release and that he would have
to remain a tiger for the rest of his days. He grew to
hate all human beings after that and killed men whenever
the chance occurred.</p>

<p>In the Sanjor and Nerbudda territories there is a
saying that if a tiger has killed a man he will never slay
another, because the dead man's spirit rides on his head
and forces him to seek more lawful prey.</p>

<p>Some African tribes believe that tailless tigers are
transformed men, probably because the wer-animal is
frequently said to have no tail.</p>

<p>In early Christian times the wer-wolf was often
regarded as a victim of the evil machinations of a sorcerer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
There is a story in the seventh century of a
man-wolf who defended the head of St. Edward the
Martyr from the onslaught of other wild beasts. The
apostles Peter and Paul, according to a Russian folk-tale,
turned an evil-minded husband and wife into
bears as a judgment for their sins.</p>

<p>An object which may have been an inducement to
transformation was the hope of acquiring second sight,
a gift with which many animals are thought to be endowed.</p>

<p>In the last century in France a connection of the old
<i>loup-garou</i> existed in the person of the <i>meneur des loups</i>,
who was said to have the gift of charming or taming
wolves, which followed him across waste lands on midnight
rambles after the style in which the rats followed
the piping of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.</p>

<p>The <i>loup-garou</i> of the French is found in Italy under
the name of the <i>lupo manaro</i> or <i>versiero</i>. The <i>lupo
manaro</i> of the Middle Ages was a witch dressed as a
wolf, but the same term was applied to a certain hobgoblin
who was peculiar to the city of Blois and whose
chief occupation seems to have been to inspire deadly
fear in young children. The <i>lupo marino</i>, which might
be thought to be another kind of wolf, is the name of a
most ravenous fish, which does not appear to have had
human attributes.</p>

<p>The great Gaston de Foix, known as Ph&#339;bus, who is
famed for his book on the chase, expresses his opinion
that the term <i>garou</i> in <i>loup-garou</i> is an ellipse of the
phrase <i>gardez-vous</i>.</p>

<p>When wolves grew scarce in England it became the
fashion for those who wished to be transformed to change
into cats, weasels, or harmless hares; rather a mild
amusement after the adventuresome exploits of the man-attacking
beasts of prey, but one which led to some
extraordinary proceedings akin to black magic.</p>

<p>In some old French Records the account is given of a
man who buried a black cat in a box at a spot where four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
cross-roads met. In the box he placed bread soaked in
holy water and holy oil, sufficient to keep the animal
alive for three days. His intention was to dig up his
innocent victim, slay him, and make a girdle of his skin,
by which means he expected to be able to transform
himself into an animal and gain the gift of clairvoyance.
Unfortunately for his projects, however, the buried
animal was exhumed by hounds. The whole affair
came to public knowledge and ended in the courts,
where the guilty man was condemned for sorcery.</p>

<p>Another man whose friend threw doubts on his power
to change into animal shape, quickly turned into a wolf
to prove that his comrade was wrong and, being set upon
by a pack of dogs, was deprived by them of one eye
before he could resume his normal appearance.</p>

<p>A thief acted more cleverly. Being condemned to the
gibbet, he saved his skin by taking the form of a wolf
directly his would-be executioners opened the door of
the cell in which he was imprisoned. During the
panic of dismay which greeted the sight of him, he
escaped into the woods.</p>

<p>One of the most marvellous stories of wer-wolves is
related by Giraldus Cambrensis in his "Topography of
Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A priest was journeying from Ulster to
Meath accompanied only by a single youth when they
were benighted in a wood.</p>

<p>They had kindled a fire when a huge wolf approached
them and spoke, telling the travellers to fear nothing.</p>

<p>The priest adjured him by all that was sacred not to
do them harm and begged him to say "what creature
it was that in the shape of a beast uttered human words."</p>

<p>The story told by the wolf is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are two of us, a man and a woman, natives of
Ossory, who, through the curse of one Natalis, saint and
abbot, are compelled every seven years to put off their
human form and assume that of wolves. At the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
seven years, if they chance to survive, two others being
substituted, they return to their former shape. Now,
she who is my partner in this visitation lies dangerously
sick not far from hence. I beseech you, inspired by divine
charity, to give her the consolations of your priestly
office."</p>

<p>The priest followed the mysterious speaker into the
thicket and performed the rites of the Church over the
dying she-wolf, as far as the last Communion. But the
wolf was not satisfied, and begged him to complete his
good offices. The priest said this was impossible as he
was not provided with the wherewithal for giving the
viaticum. Then the man-wolf pointed to the priest's
neck, suspended round which he carried a missal and
consecrated wafers, entreating him not to deny the aid
provided by Divine Providence. To remove the priest's
doubts he tore off the she-wolf's skin and exposed the
body of an old woman. The last Communion having
been given, the wolf replaced the skin and reverently
thanked the priest for the benefit which he had conferred.</p>

<p>These representative incidents go far to show how
deeply ingrained is the belief in transformation among
primitive people, but it is necessary to go back still
further into the origins of folk-lore to discover the bedrock
of thought in which the human-animal theory
takes its rise.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
THE BUSH-SOUL</h3>


<p>The animal which savage races take as a symbol of the
family becomes their totem. Many believe that their
ancestors were originally animals, fishes, or reptiles, and
are so accustomed to this idea that transformation
appears simple and natural to them. They hold that
the souls of the dead pass into one or another animal
form.</p>

<p>"Wise people," says the Bhagavad Gita, "see the same
soul (Atman) in the Brahman, in worms and in insects,
in the dog and the elephant, in beasts, cows, gadflies,
and gnats."</p>

<p>"Nothing is more strikingly characteristic of primitive
thinking than the close community of nature which it
assumes between man and brute," writes Fiske. "The
doctrine of metempsychosis, which is found in some
shape or other all over the world, implies a fundamental
identity between the two; the Hindu is taught to
respect the flocks browsing in the meadow, and will on
no account lift his hand against a cow, for who knows
but it may be his own grandmother?"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The primeval worship of ancestors and the savage
customs of totemism are connected with this belief in
transformation.</p>

<p>Primitive man cannot grasp the idea of death as final.
He believes that the man who has passed away is still
capable of communicating with the living, and the idea
of the persistence of the dead is to him the reality.
Even though a dead man has thrown off the body like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
mask, his appearance remains the same and he is still
possessed of human powers, perhaps intensified by the
experience he has undergone. He can show himself
to his friends, and may do so preferably after nightfall.
He is then wrapped to some extent in mystery,
and connected with strange sights, movements, and
sounds.</p>

<p>Gifted with new powers he may appear as an animal,
perhaps in order to harm his enemies or warn people of
evil. His howling may be heard above the sound of the
tempest. Perhaps he rides on the night-wind, perhaps he
comes in the form of a hound, as a messenger of death,
and bays under the window of the sick a warning that
death is at hand. Again, he may come as a ravening wolf
to devour some victim of his greed. Thus the savage
mind fails to distinguish between the real and the
imaginative and, basing his beliefs on the stories about
his own tribal totem, is convinced that his ancestors
may career about his home in the form of lion, leopard,
serpent or other tutelary genius. This curious mental
process expands with what it feeds on until the shade of
distinction between wolf-like ghosts and corporeal
human wolves is obliterated and the metempsychosis is
complete.</p>

<p>In "Life Amongst the Modocs,"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Joaquin Miller tells
a poetic story of the descent of the Indians from the
grizzly bear.</p>

<p>One severe spring-time many thousands of years ago
there was a storm on the summit of Mount Shasta and
the Great Spirit sent his fair daughter to speak to the
storm and bid it stop, but he told her not to look forth
from the hole in the top of the mountain lest she should
be caught in the wind and come to disaster.</p>

<p>Curiosity, however, caused her to forget her father's
instructions and she put her head out to look at the
far-distant ocean, white with storm. As she did so the
wind caught her long red hair and she was blown down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the mountain-side which was covered with ice and snow,
so that she slid to the dark belt of firs below the snow
rim.</p>

<p>This district belonged to the grizzly bears. They
were not really beasts then, but lived in caves, walked
on two legs, talked and used clubs to fight with, instead
of their teeth and claws as they do now. An old grizzly
found the red-haired girl and took her home, where she
was reared with the bears' offspring. In time she was
married to the eldest son of the family. Their children
did not resemble either of their parents exactly, but
partook somewhat of the nature and likeness of both.
Thus was the red man created, for these children were
the first Indians.</p>

<p>The legend goes on to tell how angry the Great Spirit
was when he heard what had befallen his daughter and
that he punished the grizzlies by making them walk on
all-fours like other beasts, and on account of this legend
of their origin, the Indians about Mount Shasta never
kill a bear, and if a bear kills an Indian the latter's body
is burnt and all who pass the spot cast a stone upon it
till a large heap is gathered, and Indians will point out
to this day that bears are more like men than any other
animal.</p>

<p>The members of a totem clan call themselves by the
name of the totem, and numerous clans are connected
with various animals, such, for instance, as the Crane
clan of the Ojibways who think they are descended from
a pair of cranes which settled near Lake Superior where
they became transformed by the Great Spirit into a
man and a woman. The Osages are descended from the
union between a snail and a beaver. The snail burst
its shell, grew arms and legs and became a handsome
human being who wedded a beaver maiden.</p>

<p>In Bechuanaland when a crocodile clansman sees a
crocodile he spits on the ground and says, "There is
sin," for fear the sight should give him inflammation
of the eyes. Yet the crocodile is his father, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
celebrates it at his festivals and marks his cattle with an
incision in the ear that resembles the mouth of his
totem animal.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Ellice Island in the South
Pacific believe the island was first inhabited by the
porcupine fish, whose offspring became men and women.
The snake clan among the Moquis of Arizona say they
are descended from a woman who gave birth to snakes,
and they indulge in extraordinary snake dances to
propitiate their tutelary genius.</p>

<p>In Indonesia many stories are told of women who have
brought forth animals. Sometimes the woman gives
birth to twins, one being a human being and one a beast.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
At Balen in New Guinea a native told a missionary that
his ancestress had given birth to a boy and also to an
iguana, and since then he had had a great respect for
iguanas.</p>

<p>The turtle clan of the Iroquois believe themselves to
be descended from a fat turtle, which, burdened by
the weight of its shell in walking, threw it off after
great exertions and developed gradually into a human
being.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>People of the cray-fish clan of the Choctaws were
said to have lived originally underground as cray-fish,
only coming to the surface of the mud occasionally.
Some kindly Choctaws captured these fish, taught them
to walk after cutting off their toe-nails and adopted
them into the tribe.</p>

<p>The Masai race in Uganda have a theory that some of
their ancestors return to earth after death in the shape
of serpents, generally pythons or cobras, and when a
Masai marries, he introduces his wife to the tutelary
snake of the tribe, and she is told to recognise it and
never harm it. The fetish snake is often consulted by
people in trouble, because they think they will get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
valuable advice based on the experience of their ancestors<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>The people of Miri believe themselves to be related
to large deer, and suppose that their dead relatives
become deer. The Bakongs, another group of Mohammedan
Malasians, believe their friends become bear-cats
after death. The Papuans of New Guinea hold that
at death souls of human beings pass into animals such
as cassowaries, fish, or pigs. They do not eat these
sacred creatures, which are taboo.</p>

<p>The taboos include all animals which must not be
killed. They enjoy local sanctity, and are never eaten
or even touched. Taboo animals are thought to give
favourable and unfavourable omens. Death is sometimes
foretold by their means.</p>

<p>These instances of the supposed connection between
savage races and certain animals might be multiplied a
hundredfold, and they lead to interesting developments
of the transformation theory.</p>

<p>The belief that beasts are the dwelling-places of the
souls of depraved men is a variation of the idea that
depraved men were inhabited by demons.</p>

<p>In Australia and America it is customary for savages
to have what is called "a medicine animal," something
in the nature of a tutelary genius or second soul. The
natives of Central America call this animal <i>nagual</i>, the
Algonquins <i>manitou</i>, the Eskimo <i>tornaq</i>, and amongst
the last-named people it is usually a bear. Others call it
simply the bush-soul.</p>

<p>The young Tinkhlet Indian goes out hunting the
otter, and when he has killed his prey he cuts out its
tongue, which he uses as a charm, wearing it round his
neck and believing that he now understands the language
of all animals. In other races various animals are killed
in order that part of their body may be used as a talisman.
A <i>nagual</i> may be obtained in other ways, perhaps
through dreaming of the right animal, or by having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
it chosen by the magician of the tribe. It then becomes
sacred, and should it die the man dies too.</p>

<p>The West African negroes believe that a man can have
as many as four souls, one of which lives in animal form
out in the bush, and is then called his bush-soul. If
this animal soul is trapped or shot, the man himself
dies. Nor will a native kill his bush-soul, for this would
surely be the cause of his own end. Bush-souls are
often regarded as an hereditary possession, generally
passing from father to son and from mother to daughter.
Among many primitive peoples the belief exists that
the human being can and does actually change into this
tutelary animal genius. In Iceland, for instance, it is
believed that various members of a family have a kind of
animal double called <i>fylgja</i>, in the shape of a dog or bird.</p>

<p>The Yakuts of Siberia believe that every wizard has
one of his souls incarnate in an animal. "Nobody can
find my external soul," said one famous wizard, "it
lies hidden far away in the stony mountains of Edzhigansk."
Once a year at the melting of the snow, these
souls appear amongst the dwellings of men in the shape
of animals, invisible to all but the wizards themselves.
Strong ones hurry about noisily, but the weak ones
move furtively as though afraid. Sometimes they fight,
and the sorcerer whose soul is worsted in the battle falls
ill and may even die. The souls of cowardly wizards
are in the form of dogs, and they give their human
double no peace, but gnaw at his heart and tear his
body. Powerful wizards have souls incarnate in stallions,
elks, boars, eagles, and black bears.</p>

<p>The Samoyeds in the Turukhinsk region believe that
sorcerers have a familiar in the shape of a boar, and that
they lead him by a magic belt. If the boar dies the
sorcerer too must die. Sometimes battles occur between
sorcerers who send forth their familiars to encounter
one another before they themselves meet in the flesh.</p>

<p>The Melanesians of Mota in the New Hebrides, call
the soul the <i>atai</i>, and they believe that every person has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a second self which is visible and is, in fact, the reflection
in animal form of his own personality. He and his <i>atai</i>
would rejoice or grieve, live and die together.</p>

<p>Some of the Melanesians also believe that they have
special relation to some animal or reptile with which
their life is bound up and which is named <i>tamaniu</i>. The
<i>tamaniu</i>, like the <i>atai</i>, has an objective and material
existence.</p>

<p>When its owner wishes to injure anyone he sends his
familiar to do so; if an eel it would tear or bite, if a
shark probably swallow him. If the owner falls ill, he
examines his familiar to discover what is wrong. The
imps or familiars of witches embody the same idea.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. R. Rivers quotes the case of a man whose
<i>tamaniu</i> was a lizard<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. The owner was blind and asked
a friend to help him with the ceremony of examination.
He told his friend to go and see the animal, using the
words "Look at me," referring to the lizard as himself.
The man went alone to the banyan tree where the
lizard was to be found, but when he came there he was
too frightened to call upon the animal. He was sent a
second time in the company of the sick man's son and
others, and when they reached the tree the man called
out the lizard's name, Rosasangwowut, and the <i>tamaniu</i>
appeared. It was a very large animal, larger than the
ordinary lizards in Mota. It appeared to be sluggish
and walked as a sick man would walk. The blind man's
son then asked the <i>tamaniu</i> if it was ill and the creature
nodded its head and moved slowly back to the tree.
They went back and told the man that his familiar
was ill, and soon afterwards he died. At the same time
the banyan tree fell, which was taken as a sign that the
<i>tamaniu</i> died too. This is an uncanny story which brings
out strongly the psychic connection between the man
and his representative animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>In Melanesia a native doctor was once attending a
patient when a large eagle hawk soared past the house
and a hunter was about to shoot it when the doctor
called out in alarm, "Don't fire, that is my spirit! If
you kill it I shall die." He also said, "If you see a rat
to-night, don't drive it away, it's my spirit, or a snake
may come to-night, which will be my spirit." Apparently
the doctor had the power to send his familiar
in animal form for the purpose of working a cure.</p>

<p>At Ongek in the Gaboon a French missionary spent
the night in the hut of a Fan chief. He was awakened
before daylight by the rustling of dry leaves and, lighting
a torch, perceived a huge black poisonous serpent,
coiled and ready to strike. He was about to shoot the
horrible reptile when his arm was suddenly struck up
by the chief, who, extinguishing the torch, cried, "Don't
fire, I beg of you. In killing the snake you would kill
me. That serpent is my <i>elangela</i>. Fear nothing!"
Speaking thus he seized and caressed the noisome reptile,
which showed emotions of delight rather than fear or
anger. Then the chief bore away his serpent and laid
it in another hut, lying down beside it, after exhorting
the missionary never to speak of what he had seen.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>From this occurrence it will easily be gathered that it
is highly dangerous to kill a <i>tamaniu</i>, <i>nagual</i>, or <i>manitou</i>.</p>

<p>The possibility of the soul existing temporarily apart
from the body is believed by most savages, and civilised
races, such as the Romans, have held identical ideas.
"The <i>nagual</i>," writes W. Northcote Thomas in his
valuable article on Animals,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> "is the lineal ancestor of
the <i>genius</i> of the Romans, no less than of the <i>guides</i> of
modern spiritualism." This statement gives ample
food for thought.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
HUMAN SOULS IN ANIMAL BODIES</h3>


<p>At all periods of the world's history and in every
country people have believed in the "external soul" of
a man appearing in animal form. For instance, in the
island of Florida the natives tell the story of an alligator
which used to come out of the sea and visit the village
in which the man whose ghost it was had dwelt. It
was known by his name and was on friendly terms with
the natives, allowing children to ride on its back.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In Syria there are stories of girls being carried off
by bears and giving birth to human-animal offspring.
The Creeks believe the offspring to be bears which
later turn into men. Japan is famous for its white
bear-god and the Tartars believe that earth spirits
take the form of bears.</p>

<p>The Gilyaks believe that if one of their race is killed
by a bear, his soul transmigrates into the animal's body.
Californian Indians have been heard to plead hard for
the life of a she-bear. They said its wrinkled face was
like the withered features of a dead grandmother whose
soul had entered into the animal.</p>

<p>One of the Omaha clans believe they are descended
from bison and the males wear their hair in imitation of
the animal which is their totem.</p>

<p>The Ewe negroes of Togoland ascribe to the souls of
buffaloes and leopards the power of killing the hunter
who slew them, or of misleading him in the chase so
that he confuses men with animals and gets into difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
from being accused of murdering the former.
The souls of these dangerous animals are thought to
haunt and plague the hunter, perhaps by making him
crazy, so that when he finds his way back into the town
he loses all his property and is sold into slavery. A quaint
ceremony is performed to prevent such power emanating
from the dead prey.</p>

<p>The Baganda natives are in deadly terror of the ghosts
of the buffaloes they have killed, believing that they
may work harm to them.</p>

<p>The crocodile especially has played a large part in
these beliefs about human and ghostly animals.</p>

<p>Natives in Simbang, in German New Guinea, are convinced
that their relatives turn into crocodiles, and they
recognise a certain crocodile known by the name of
"Old Butong" as head of the family. They say he was
born of a woman. Mary Kingsley tells a similar story
in her "Travels in West Africa," describing human
beings, who, disguised as alligators, swim in the creeks,
attack the canoes and carry off the crew. The natives
believe in the spirit of the man actually possessing the
animal's body.</p>

<p>In New Guinea and the East Indies as well as in West
Africa crocodiles are thought to be the abodes of the
souls of ancestors, and the victim of this dangerous
reptile is said to have incurred the vengeance of some
human being who has taken the form of the animal,
while those who kill crocodiles become themselves
transformed after death. Spenser's "cruell craftie
crocodile" was held to be sacred in Egypt, and the god
Sebek was said to take its shape whenever he so desired.</p>

<p>The Malagasy view is that the crocodile is the ally
of a magician during his lifetime, and that he can send
him forth as a familiar to wreak harm upon his enemies.</p>

<p>The alligator is closely allied to the crocodile. Among
the legends of the Arawak Indians of British Guiana is
one about a half human beast of this species which
received its extraordinary markings in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
manner: Arawadi, the sun-god, coming to earth saw an
alligator disporting himself on the banks of a stream
which he had preserved specially for fish. To get rid of
the enemy he seized and smote him with a hard club
upon the head and tail, but the alligator, crying out to
him to stay his hand, promised in return for clemency a
beauteous water-sprite to be his bride. Arawadi agreed
to the proposal.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The reptile's wounds were healed. Those blows<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No more his hide assail;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But still their marks are seen, 'tis said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Indented on his battered head<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And notched along his tail!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The domestic animals, bulls, cows, horses, asses, cats,
and dogs, have been regarded at one time or another as
gifted with human powers, or as suitable vehicles for
the reception of human souls. The Tlaxcallans believe
that man can be transformed into a dog. The wild dog,
the coyote, according to the ideas of the Navajos, may be
a bad man transformed at death for his sins.</p>

<p>Armenians sacrifice an ass at the graves of people who
owe them money, their belief being that if payment is
not forthcoming the ancestor's souls will enter asses'
bodies.</p>

<p>The Corn Spirit is supposed to take the form of a cat,
and in some places in Germany children have been
warned not to go into the corn-fields because "The
cat sits there." In Silesia the reaper who cuts the last
corn is called the "Tom-cat" and is dressed up in rye-stalks,
wearing a long plaited tail. Sometimes another
man accompanies him called "the female cat."</p>

<p>The Lapps of the North Cape are said to consult a
black cat when in trouble, and they regard it more as a
human being than as an animal.</p>

<p>The cat is among the soul-animals familiar to the
inhabitants of the British Islands, who, owing to this
country's immunity from wild beasts, are satisfied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
"humanise" the milder species of creatures such as the
ant, butterfly, gull, moth, sparrow, and swan.</p>

<p>In the parish of Ballymoyer in Ireland butterflies are
said to be the souls of grandfathers, whilst the Malagasy
trace their descent from a moth, believing that a man
was changed into a moth when he died. Many races
believe that moths and butterflies are the souls of the
dead.</p>

<p>In the Solomon Islands, if a native declared he intended
to transmigrate into a butterfly, his children, on
seeing one of these insects would cry "That is Daddy"
and make some suitable offering of food. Witches have
been known to have butterflies and moths as familiars.</p>

<p>In Cornwall ants are thought to be the souls of children
who died without baptism. Hindus also associate this
insect with the souls of the dead, and natives of New
Guinea believe that a second death occurs after the first
and that the soul is transformed into an ant.</p>

<p>The Athabascan Dog-Ribs believe that an ant inserted
beneath the skin of the palm endows the owner
of the hand with the gift of prophecy.</p>

<p>The Sudanese think that a wer-man has to approach
an ants' nest before being transformed into a hyæna.</p>

<p>Besides the ant the bat is regarded as a mysterious
creature, and this form was frequently assumed by
Chamalcan, god of the Cakchiquels. Large bats abound
in an island on the Ivory Coast in West Africa and are
regarded as embodying the souls of the dead. In Tonga
the same superstition holds good. Bats and birds appear
so similar when flying at dusk that it is natural to find
that birds also are often the form in which human
spirits take wing.</p>

<p>The Warrar races of Guiana have a very poetical
belief about the spirits of the departed. They visit
the fair isle of Trinidad,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where souls of good men they could find,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In glittering humming-birds confined."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The Arawaks believe that vultures belong to a race
which lives in a country above the sky. When at home
the vultures cease to be birds and assume the shape
and habits of human beings.</p>

<p>The Kalitas hold that when a man dies his soul is
carried to spirit-land by a little bird, and if he has been
an evil-doer during his lifetime, a hawk overtakes and
swallows the bird.</p>

<p>In County Mayo swans are the souls of virgins who
have been remarkable for the purity of their lives. This
idea is as beautiful as the Bohemian tradition that
children hop about the meadows in the form of frogs
is quaint.</p>

<p>An old Hindu story that monkeys were originally men
has a distinctly comic side to it. They contracted debts
and when called upon to pay fled from their creditors
by changing into monkeys and putting their tails between
their legs. In this undignified position they made off
at full speed into the jungle.</p>

<p>The stories of human souls in various animal bodies
would fill a volume, and perhaps one of the most picturesque
ideas of the kind is that of the Cornish fisherfolk
who say they see the spirits of their drowning
companions transformed into animal shapes as they pass
away from this earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
ANIMAL DANCES</h3>


<p>The ceremonial dances and festivals of primitive races
in which animal masks and skins are used are closely
connected with the idea of ancestor worship and with
transformation. After careful study of the subject it
will be regarded as certain that the performers, by
means of mimic action, rhythmic and imitative sounds,
as well as by narcotic drugs and pungent or penetrating
perfumes, induce in themselves an hypnotic or excited
state in which they believe they change into the actual
animal they represent.</p>

<p>Some of the dances are infinitely elaborate in detail,
and are so complicated in their various figures and their
symbolic intention that primitive ideas are almost lost
sight of, but a certain fundamental similarity can be
found in them all which is based on root ideas of animal
worship, the desire to propitiate animals in the chase,
the belief in animal gods, or spirits of ancestors appearing
in animal form and the desire to bring about, by sacrifice
and offering, the fertility of the species.</p>

<p>Such exercises are both religious and magical, to
secure charms against bodily ills, and for good hunting
as well as for recreation. In special family dances the
performers mimic the actions and cries of their totemic
animals.</p>

<p>In its most primitive form the animal disguise was
used by savages when acting in the capacity of a decoy,
with the object of securing food and clothing. The
early Indian when trapping buffalo went forth carrying
a dress made of the skin of a buffalo, wearing its head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and horns over his own head. As soon as he had induced
the herd to pursue him, he led them into a trap or
ambush, or over a precipice which was fatal to many
of them.</p>

<p>The Eskimo, when hunting the seal, wears a sealskin
garment which makes him look so much like his prey
that at a distance he is only distinguished from it with
difficulty. When close to the animal he utters sounds
like those of a blowing seal.</p>

<p>Also when hunting deer he imitates their grunt, and
two hunters on the same track carry guns on their
shoulders to resemble the animal's antlers. Zuni hunters
after deer wear cotton shirts with the sleeves rolled up
to the elbow, the back and front of the shirt being
coloured so as to represent the animal's body, the arms
stained to represent the deer's forelegs. Head and
antlers are carried on the shoulders, and the stalkers
approach the game, browsing as they go.</p>

<p>Out of the simple imitation of animal motions and
cries for the purpose of decoy, the dance grew more
complicated, with wild whirling figures and elaborate
dresses and masks. From a useful and necessary disguise
for purposes of obtaining food, the wolf-robe and mask
became, in unscrupulous hands, an instrument for
personal aggrandisement and gain through intimidation.
The hideous animal-mask was first used as a shield or
protection for the face in defence against the onslaught
upon an opposing force. Then it became an instrument
with which to inspire terror and fear in those who
beheld it from the point of view of its ugliness or frightfulness,
and finally it was worn as a device or symbol
of superhuman agencies. At this stage it formed an
integral part of the paraphernalia used in religious performances,
and when worn during ceremonial the
wearer became imbued in some mysterious manner
with the spirit of the being represented by the mask.</p>

<p>To gain the characteristics of an animal a wizard
attached crow and owl plumes to his head, that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
have the eyes of a crow and quickly become aware of
the approach of man, or of the owl that he might travel
by night.</p>

<p>A Zuni man, hearing the hoot of an owl, yet recognising
it as human, discovered one of his own race
hidden in the thicket. "Ah," he cried, "why do you
wear those plumes upon your head? Aha! you must
be a wizard!"</p>

<p>The Omaha coyote dance is performed by warriors
to keep up their spirits. Each dancer wears an animal
skin, and imitates the action of a coyote, trotting and
glancing round. In dance and song the performers
imagine themselves to be transformed into the animal.
In the Omaha buffalo dance, four men are attired in
great shaggy skins, the horns above their heads and the
hair hanging down below the chest. Other dances are
in imitation of wolves, grizzly bears, horses or tigers.</p>

<p>Pawnees dance the bison dance in war habit and with
bison skins and horns over their heads. The Creeks
dance similarly, uttering sounds in imitation of the
bison, their bodies bent almost double and two staffs
being held to represent the animal's forelegs.</p>

<p>The initiation day has at its root the idea of transforming
the man into a member of the kin by giving
him a share of the nature of the animal. Dances may
give magical power over the animal to be chased, and
are performed before a hunting expedition. In the
dance the animal goes down before the onslaught of
the hunter, and so the real animal, it is hoped, will fall
a victim to his weapons. Dances after hunting are of a
protective nature, so that the soul of the slaughtered
animal may have no evil effect upon the slayer. Another
form of animal dance is performed with a view to increase
the number of animals. Among the Mandan
Indians, for instance, an animal festival is held, at which
a man, painted black to represent the evil one, enters a
village from the prairie, chases and terrifies the women
and acts the part of a buffalo in a dance which is intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to ensure a good supply of this valuable animal during
the year to come. Other American tribes have a similar
masquerade, in which males, dressed in buffalo skins,
take the part of male buffaloes and the females personify
the female animals, with a view to bringing about an
increase of the species.</p>

<p>Legendary animals, or spirits, are also represented in
the elaborate masked pantomimes of the Indian tribes
in North West America. The explanation given by the
natives is that the ceremonial was instituted in ancient
days when man had still the form of an animal; and
before the great transformer had given him a distinctive
shape. This ceremonial, performed by man-animals, is
a dramatised form of myth, in which the actors attempt to
reproduce certain trance-states by sympathetic mimicry.</p>

<p>The Eskimos of Bering Strait perform remarkable
dances in which curious mythological beasts, said to
inhabit sea and land, become visible and occasionally
play a part. Strange forms, probably of known animals
modified and adapted, are conjured to appear. The
dance is based on the old belief that in the early days all
animate beings had a dual existence, choosing to be
men or animals as the will prompted them. If an
animal wished to be transformed into a man, the body
was drawn erect and the foreleg or wing was raised so
that it pushed up the jowl or beak, and thus changed
the form and features into something more manlike.
It is still believed by these races that animals have this
power, and the form taken is called <i>inua</i> and represents
the psychical part of the creature, at death appearing
as its shade. The wizards are said to have the power of
piercing the animal mask and recognising the human
features it conceals.</p>

<p>Masks may also represent totemic animals, and the
dancers are then transformed into these special creatures,
or at least are moved by their spiritual essence.</p>

<p>Some of these masks are made with double faces, so
that the muzzle of the animal fits over and conceals the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
face of the <i>inua</i> and the outer mask is hinged on or held
in place by pegs so that it may be removed at any minute.
The psychological moment when actual transformation
occurs is symbolised at a particular part of the ceremony.</p>

<p>The wearer of the mask then becomes imbued with
the true spirit of the animal represented, and the dance
turns into a species of thanksgiving for the hunter's
success.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Dancing is sometimes used as a form of exorcism.</p>

<p>In Abyssinia a disorder similar to that of being possessed
by a <i>bouda</i>, or sorcerer, is called <i>tigritiya</i>, and is a
supposed possession by the devil in which the victim,
who is generally a woman, believes that she has been
transformed into an animal. Whatever the patient
demands must be procured, for else she becomes sulky
and, covering up her head, remains for days without
eating or speaking. Since the symptoms always include
the wasting away of the attacked person, this state is
very dangerous.</p>

<p>Ornaments of all kinds have to be borrowed in answer
to her lightest whim. She asks for the lion's skin worn
by a warrior, his silver ornaments, or other valuable
articles difficult to procure. In some cases music is
used as a means of charming away the <i>tigritiya</i>. Drums
and other instruments strike up and the patient moves her
body in time to the music and gradually increases her
energy until the pace is furious and her motions so
violent that it seems likely she will dislocate her limbs,
if not her neck. Having lain on a bed of sickness, reduced
to a mere bag of bones, such fatiguing exercises
appear uncanny, but it is on this dancing and on her
incantations that the ejection of the evil spirit depends.</p>

<p>Some of the dances imitate the antics of bush-hogs
and other animals desirous of fun rather than of injury
to human beings. In one of the Acawoio dances, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
dancer has a kind of trumpet to which a rudely carved
figure of some animal or reptile is fixed, and he impersonates
this animal for the time being.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Musical instruments used in the dances are frequently
made of animal skins, and the Indians attribute special
virtues to the wolf-skin.</p>

<p>It is said that a tom-tom or drum made of this animal's
skin can silence any similar instrument made of sheep's
skin from which no man can emit a sound while the wolf-skin
vibrates.</p>

<p>Real animals often play a part in the ceremonial,
especially snakes in the serpent dances and sacred animals
in such dances as are dedicated to their worship.</p>

<p>In China a big dog is dressed up like a man and is
carried round in a palanquin to break up a drought.</p>

<p>Masks and animal skins worn at dances are, of course,
not confined to the use of primitive races, but have been
employed since ancient days in every kind of masque,
dance, and pantomime. Much might be written on their
symbolic meaning, and attention may be drawn to the
special instance of the <i>festa asinaria</i> of mediæval days
at which dancers wore the heads of asses.</p>

<p>Besides the masks and animal skins, ordinary clothing
was often made to represent special animals. For
instance, at Athens, Artemis was worshipped in ceremonies
at which young maidens attired in saffron gowns
danced a particular movement and were called "bears."</p>

<p>The Royal family of Dahomey worship the leopard,
and some of the king's wives are distinguished by the
title of "leopard wives" and wear striped cloths to
resemble the animal.</p>

<p>Many savages paint a rude picture of the animal they
represent upon the clothes worn, and this is a special
feature of some of the extraordinary snake dancers,
especially amongst the Moquis.</p>

<p>These dances as well as those of the Hopis are expressions
of clan totemism rather than of snake worship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Several figures in the Maya codices represent human
beings, evidently personifying deities and wearing the
symbolic masks of animal gods. One of the human
figures in the Codex Cortesianus wears the mask of a
snake. The Hopi usually carries only the head of the
animal personified, but the Mexican dresses in the
skin. In some examples the head-dress is most elaborate,
the head being painted green, with open mouth and
red lips dotted with black, two pendant white, tooth-shaped
projections hanging from the upper jaw. From
the mouth a red tongue lolls. The eye is oval, with
curved lines drawn upon the pupil, and the whole is
capped by a crescentic figure towering above the head.
Three triangular-shaped plumes extend from the cap,
and over the nose a red-coloured flap hangs. Though
usually green, the heads are sometimes painted white
or brown, but none is red or yellow. In the Hopi
folk-tales it is said that the waters of the world come
from the breasts of the great snake, and sometimes a
female figure, bearing a snake as a head-dress, is symbolised
with water flowing from her breasts. Another
symbolic figure has a snake's body with curious markings
and a head practically drawn in identical lines with
that of a human being. No doubt this represents a
man transformed into, or personifying, a snake. At
any rate, he wears the mask and represents the feathered
snake ceremonially.</p>

<p>A number of animals are represented in Tusayan
ceremonials and are then called <i>Katcinas</i>, which means
the supernatural being personified, as well as the dance
or act of personification. Besides the coyote, the wolf,
the cougar, the bear, the antelope, and the badger,
which figure largely among the supernatural beings
found in the Sia ritual, the hawk, the man eagle, the
bee, butterfly, mountain sheep, and owl all play an
important part in Tusayan ceremonial. No women
wear <i>Katcina</i> masks in a Hopi ceremony, the female
<i>Katcinas</i> being invariably represented by men. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
masked dances amongst the Pueblos, in which animal
personifications take place and masks are worn, are
called <i>Katcina</i> dances. They take place between January
and August.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The following strange ceremony is practised by
Mexicans and is not unlike the Hopi snake dance. It
is celebrated once in every eight years about October or
November.</p>

<p>After fasting for some days, says one who has seen
the dance, the natives disguised themselves in all manner
of animal and bird dresses, and came up dancing to the
chosen spot where the rain-god had been placed before
a pool of water in which live snakes and frogs were
swimming. The Macateca, which may be rendered
"those from Deerland," then seized upon the wriggling
reptiles with the mouth, never touching them with
the hand, and attempted to swallow them alive, dancing
all the time. He who managed to swallow the first
snake cried out, "papa, papa" and danced round about
the temple. After two days of these extraordinary
exertions a procession was formed and all marched slowly
four times round the temple. Then came a feast of
fruit and pastry which had been placed ready in baskets
for the purpose, and the ceremonial was ended. The
old men and women present, knowing that there would
be no repetition of the dance for eight years, wept
bitterly at the close of the performance.</p>

<p>In a festival in vogue among the Cholutecas, a slave of
good figure, and no personal blemish, is dressed for
forty days in the same animal skin and mask which
represent the special god to be personified.</p>

<p>The dresses of the Moquis during their serpent dances
are fashioned of painted cotton kilts, of a reddish-yellow
colour, decorated with narrow bands of yellow
and green, and bordered by a narrow black stripe. At
the bottom is a fringe of small bells of lead or tin. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
snake is painted in the folds of the kilt, covered with
white spots and bordered by narrow white lines. The
arms and legs of the dancers are naked, but dangling
to their heels behind they wear skins of the fox or
coyote.</p>

<p>Marching solemnly round a sacred stone, they begin
by shaking rattles and waving snake-wands to which
eagle feathers are attached. After some chanting, a
number of women, dressed in white and red mantles,
come forward and scatter corn-meal from baskets with
which they are provided. Presently the head priest,
followed by a number of male performers, marching
two and two, come forward towards the sacred rock,
carrying live snakes in their mouths and hands. Some
of the Indians tickle the heads, necks, and jaws of the
wriggling serpents to distract their attention from those
who are grasping their bodies firmly between their
teeth.</p>

<p>When the snake-carriers reach the further end of
the space cleared for the dance they spit the snakes
out upon the ground and, facing the sacred rock, stamp
the left foot twice, giving forth strange sounds, half
grunt, half wail.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour this mad dance of wriggling snakes,
rushing figures, and clouds of whirling corn-meal continues
and then the snakes are released, the symbolic
dance is over and the performers resume their ordinary
clothes and, presumably, their natural human proclivities.
The origin of this dance lies in the belief
that the Moquis are descended from snakes and is told
thus by the natives:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many years ago the Moquis used to live on the
other side of a high mountain beyond the San Juan
River in Colorado. The chief thought he would take a
trip down the big river, so he made himself a boat of a
hollow cottonwood log, took some provisions and started
down. The stream carried him to the sea-shore, where
he found some shells. When he arrived on the beach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
he saw a number of houses on the cliff in which lived
many men and women who had white under their eyes,
and below that a white mark on their cheeks. That
night he took one of the women as his wife. Shortly
after his return the woman gave birth to snakes, and this
was the origin of the snake family or clan which manages
the dance. When she gave birth to these snakes they
bit a number of the children of the Moquis. The Moquis
then moved in a body to their present villages and they
have this dance to conciliate the snakes so they won't bite
their children."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Snake worship and ancestor or spirit worship seems
here combined in the same rite, and the Moquis evidently
believe in the transmigration of souls. The
dancers belong to a Secret Society, a sort of Serpent
Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The peculiar qualities said to distinguish departed
relatives, reappearing in the form of snakes, from the
ordinary reptiles are that they will frequent the huts,
never eat mice and show no fear of man. "Sometimes,"
says Sir John Lubbock in his "Origin of Civilisation,"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
"a snake is recognised as the representative of a
given man by some peculiar mark or scar, the absence
of an eye, or some similar point of resemblance."</p>

<p>The noiseless movement and the rapid action of the
serpent, combined with its fascinating gaze and magnetic
power, no doubt lead savages to view it as a possessor of
wisdom and embodiment of spirits.</p>

<p>The Kobena and other Indians of Brazil perform
masked dances in honour of their dead. They have a
butterfly dance in which two performers represent
large blue butterflies fluttering in the sunshine. Darting
swallows are also mimicked by masked dancers, as well
as vultures, owls, fish, jaguars, and, curiously enough,
the sloth, in which dance a man hangs for a long time
to the bough of a tree or the cross-beam of a hut. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
strange sight is the sandfly dance, in which a swarm of
masked men make the air dark with their antics.</p>

<p>All these performances are based on certain magical
formulæ. A mysterious force permeates the dancer,
beneath his mask, and for the time being he has become
a mighty animal demon or spirit, capable of unlimited
powers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
MAN-ANIMAL AND ANIMAL-MAN</h3>


<p>In remote ages man and animal were closely bound by a
thousand ties. Under barbaric conditions human beings
and animals lived, as it were, in touch with one another,
they were next-door neighbours in the primeval forests,
their necessities were the same to a large extent and
their tastes did not widely differ. Both were actuated
by the need of shelter, food, and protection against
enemies. Is it surprising, then, that primitive man was
closely allied to his less intelligent brothers, and that he
believed them to be endowed with feelings and desires
akin to his own?</p>

<p>Owing to his powers of mental growth, however, it
was not long before man's instincts developed above
those of the beasts. He was still, in reality, a savage
animal, but he had more skill and ingenuity in the art
of killing, as soon as he began to realise that a stick, a
stone, or other weapons could be used to beat out the
life of other animals.</p>

<p>Gradually he found out that he possessed higher
qualities on the mental plane, and that he had the
power of conscious spiritual development which was
apparently denied to brute creatures.</p>

<p>Many writers have endeavoured to formulate the
great kinship which exists amongst all created beings
in this particular aspect of the evolution of soul.</p>

<p>"There is not any matter, nor any spirit, nor any
creature, but it is capable of a unity of some kind with
other creatures," writes Ruskin;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> "and in that unity
is its perfection and theirs, and a pleasure also for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
beholding of all other creatures that can behold. So
the unity of spirits is partly in their sympathy and
partly in their giving and taking, and always in their
love; and these are their delight and their strength;
for their strength is their co-working and army fellowship,
and their delight is in their giving and receiving
of alternate and perpetual good; their inseparable
dependancy on each other's being, and their essential
and perfect depending on their Creator's."</p>

<p>"Let us label beings by what they are," says a more
modern writer,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> "by the souls that are in them and the
deeds they do&mdash;not by their colour, which is pigment,
nor by their composition, which is clay. There are
philanthropists in feathers and patricians in fur, just
as there are cannibals in the pulpit and saurians among
the money-changers."</p>

<p>The great seer, Prentice Mulford, believed that the
spirit of an animal could actually be re-embodied in a
man or woman, and he thought that its prominent
characteristics would appear in that man or woman.
The mother might attract to her the spirit of some more
intelligent or highly developed savage animal. That
spirit would then lose its identity as a quadruped and
reappear in the body of the new-born child.</p>

<p>"Remember," he writes, "that as to size and shape
the spirit of a horse need not be like the horse materialised
in flesh and blood. Spirit takes hold of a mass of matter
and holds that matter in accordance with its ruling
desire and the amount of its intelligence. An anaconda
is but the faint spark of intelligence only awakened
into desire to swallow and digest. Such low forms of
life as the reptile or fish have not even awakened into
affection for their young. The reptile, as to spirit or
intellect, is but a remove from the vegetable. Trees
have life of their own; they are gregarious, and grow
in communities. The spirit of the old tree reanimates
the new one. There is in the vegetable kingdom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
unconscious desire for refinement, for better forms of
life. For this reason is the entire vegetable kingdom of
a finer type than ages ago, when the world's trees and
plants, though immense in size, were coarse in fibre and
in correspondence with the animal life about them."</p>

<p>The true evolution, then, is that of spirit, taking on
itself through successive ages many re-embodiments and
adding to itself some new quality with each re-embodiment.</p>

<p>The survival of the fittest implies that the best
qualities so gathered do survive. The lower, coarse and
more savage are gradually sloughed off. The best
qualities in all animal forms of life eventually are gathered
in a man. He has so gained or absorbed into himself
courage from the lion, cunning from the fox, rapaciousness
from vulture and eagle. You often see the eagle
or vulture beak on one person's face, the bulldog on
that of another, the wolf, the fox, and so on. Faces
hang out no false sign of the character of the spirit.
Man, unconsciously recognising this, uses the terms
"foxy," "wolfish," "snaky," and even "hoggish," in
describing the character of certain individuals.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Most people are able to find physical similarities
between human beings and animals. The equine man
who moves his ears is not rarely to be met with. The
person who uncovers his canine teeth in a snarl is an
even more common type. Short women who flap their
arms and waddle in the style of penguins; tall ones who
have the graceful sliding movement of the giraffe; persons
of either sex who jerk along with hops like feathered
creatures on a lawn are all to be met with any day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heron stalks in with solemnity and stateliness,
and cranes her neck to find something she has mislaid.
She has a prying face, sharp nose, and small projecting
chin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Lion faces, tiger faces, cat faces, fox faces, fish faces,
bird faces, sheep faces, and rat faces meet us at every
turn.</p>

<p>Sheep men are mild in appearance, beaming with
amiability, truthfulness, and freedom from cant. Ox
faces are more robust, with wider and broader features,
and a certain flatness of face. People of this appearance
have good dispositions, good appetite, are stubborn in
bargains perhaps, but reliable and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Hercules was depicted with a powerful neck, a small
head, short and curly hair, which bore a striking resemblance
to a vigorous and untamable bull, whilst Herod
was like a fox, with thin face, cunning eye, restless
head and neck, artful and deceptive with highly strung
nerves.</p>

<p>The weasel man is thin, tall, sharp-eyed, always in a
hurry, and the nose that augurs badly is that which is
strikingly similar to the beak of a parrot. The parrot-man
is filled with a sense of his own importance and is
an endless prattler. Those who have a high and narrow
forehead and a nose that terminates like the beak of a
crow are sure to be subject to vile passions.</p>

<p>Beaumarchais said wittily, "Boire sans soif et faire
l'amour en tout temps, c'est ce que distingue l'homme de
la bête."</p>

<p>Artists, too, have attempted to depict the animal
spirit that dwells in human beings. Sir Joshua Reynolds
painted two portraits of young girls, one holding a
cage with a mouse in it, the other a kitten. The former is
called Muscipula,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the latter Felina, and it may be
surmised that he intended to show in their features
the imitative sympathy young children have with young
animals, for Muscipula's expression is that of the mouse.</p>

<p>Charles Le Brun, the artist, worked out the same idea
in a less symbolic and more practical manner, from the
physiognomical aspect, in his series of drawings illustrative
of the relation between human physiognomy and
brute creation which depict man's features transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in many animal countenances.</p>

<p>"Man is a talkative and religious ape," says J. Howard
Moore in "The Universal Kinship,"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and goes on to
point out that while man has expressed his opinion about
animals constantly, he has never had the opportunity
of hearing what animals have to say about human beings.
Although we know what a lion looks like when painted
by a man, "human eyes have never yet been illumined
by the sardonic lineaments of a man painted by a lion."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Emerson expressed something of the same idea when
confronting the inmates of a stable or menagerie. "What
compassion," he cries, "do these imprisoning forms
awaken! You may sometimes catch the glance of a
dog which lays a kind of claim to sympathy and brotherhood.
What! somewhat of me down there? Does
he know it? Can he, too, as I, go out of himself, see
himself, perceive relations? We fear lest the poor brute
should gain one dreadful glimpse of his condition, should
learn in some moment the tough limitation of this
fettering organisation. It was in this glance that Ovid
got the hint of his metamorphosis; Calidasa of his
transmigration of souls.</p>

<p>"For these fables are our own thoughts carried out.
What keeps these wild tales in circulation for thousands
of years? What but the wild fact to which they suggest
some approximation of theory! Nor is the fact quite
solitary, for in varieties of our own species where organisation
seems to predominate over the genius of man, in
Kalmuck or Malay or Flathead Indian, we are sometimes
pained by the same feeling; and sometimes, too, the
sharp-witted prosperous white man awakens it. In a
mixed assembly we have chanced to see not only a glance
at Abdiel so grand and keen, but also in other faces the
features of the mink, of the bull, of the rat, and the
barn-door fowl."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The great Chinese Epic "A Journey to Heaven,"
depicts the gradual evolution of the beast into man
and the transformation of character from unpromising
materials into saints worthy of heaven. The monkey's
ambition, the pig's love of ease and the horse's one talent
of bearing burdens are all made to play their part in
working out the salvation of man. One of the chief
characters in the story is Sun Wu King, who personates
the irrepressible human mind, an inventive genius full
of resource who begins with monkey inquisitiveness to
discover the reasons of things and presently develops
into a man of science and an inventor.</p>

<p>The pig impersonates man's lower nature and demons
represent the untamed passions of man. One demon
having once been a clever, handsome man, became
extremely ugly with a snout like a pig and long flapping
ears. He tells his story thus: "Since I was born I have
been stupid and loved ease night and day. I received
the pill of nine Transformations and studied all the arts
by which man could be united to the powers above and
below, till at last I was able to fly with a light but strong
body and was a guest in the celestial Court." Thence
he was thrown out for misdemeanours and made to take
the shape of a pig, but gradually he was weaned to
better things and lost his animal propensities.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
SCAPEGOAT AND SAINT</h3>


<p>According to the tradition of the scapegoat, the evil
or lower side of man can be transferred from him to an
animal. In this process of removing disease or sin, the
bad spirit is expelled from the human being and enters
the form of some beast. In India the scape-animal may
be a pig, buffalo, a goat or a black cock.</p>

<p>The Jews had the custom of bringing a goat to the
door of the Tabernacle and the high priest laid the sins
of the people upon the animal, sending it thereafter
away with its burden into the wilderness.</p>

<p>In Thibet a human scapegoat, dressed in goat's skin,
is kicked out of the community as soon as the people have
confessed their sins, and wealthy Moors keep a wild boar
in their stables as a vehicle for the evil spirits to enter
into which might otherwise injure their horses.</p>

<p>The Kaffirs sometimes take a goat in the presence of a
sick man and confess sins over him. Then a few drops
of the patient's blood are allowed to fall on the animal's
head and the sickness is thought to be transferred, the
animal being turned loose over the veld. The medicine-men
of the Baganda races perform a similar operation,
taking hold of the animal and tying upon it some herbs
they have passed over the patient's body. Then the
animal is driven away to waste land, and the sick man is
supposed to recover. The Baganda people transmit the
sins of a dead man to a calf, the animal being led three
times round the bier and the hand of the dead man
being placed on its head, by which act the calf takes upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
itself the evil done by the deceased. Then the scapegoat
is driven on to waste land, where it cannot contaminate
anybody.</p>

<p>Thus Christ, in the country of the Gadarenes, permitted
devils to use swine as scapegoats when driving
them out of two men possessed. The unclean spirits
besought the favour of Him, and the whole herd of
swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
perished in the waters.</p>

<p>St. Regulus, archbishop of Arles and Senlis, was once
confronted by a man possessed of a devil. The devil
besought him, saying, "If you cast me out suffer me
to enter into the body of this ass," and the bishop
said, "Go!" When the devil was about to enter
into the ass, the animal, aware of his intention, made
the sign of the cross on the ground with his fore-foot
and the devil found it impossible to obtain his body
and had to pass on, leaving the ass unmolested.</p>

<p>In another scapegoat story the devil leaves the possessed
man in the form of two worms:</p>

<p>Jean de la Roque was a young nobleman of vicious
habits. St. Francis of Paula hearing of the youth's evil
ways sent a messenger to arrest him and had him locked
up in a monastery. Roque was furious at this manner
of tampering with his liberty and, vowing vengeance
on those who detained him, beat on the door of his cell
and uttered loud cries. At last, exhausted by passion,
he lay down on the floor and slept. Then St. Francis
entered the cell and, waking the young sinner, said to
him coldly, "How now, friend, what thinkest thou?
Pull from thine ear that which torments thee so." The
young man, still half asleep, put his hand to his right
ear and drew forth a hideous hairy worm of monstrous
size. Then putting his hand to his left ear he drew
forth another similar worm. Thus the devil by which
he had been possessed came forth in the form of two
worms, and the young man, returning to himself, threw
himself at the saint's feet and prayed for pardon. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
was formally admitted to the monastery and remained
there as a monk until 1520.</p>

<p>Birds, too, have been employed to carry away any evil,&mdash;from
leprosy to freckles.</p>

<p>The idea of the scapegoat is closely bound up with,
and typifies the substitution of the Christ for sinners
and His eternal removal of their transgressions.</p>

<p>In the legends of the saints, also, animals take upon
themselves the burden of sins committed and no human
beings are more closely related to the brute creation
than the holy men, who frequently treated them as
though they were brothers. St. Francis of Assisi spoke
to birds and animals in the same tone that he used to his
friends, and he often went into solitudes and preached
to the cattle of the field, the fishes of the sea, the birds
of the air, and the beasts of the forest; dumb creatures
which listened attentively to the words of wisdom which
fell from his lips. One day when he was preaching at
Alviano, the swallows were twittering so loudly that he
grew annoyed. Breaking off suddenly in his discourse,
he said, "My sisters, the swallows, please keep peace
while I am preaching." After that they disturbed him
no more.</p>

<p>There are many stories in which saints are assisted in
their work by animals. St. Gentius made a wolf which
had eaten one of his oxen help him with the ploughing.
St. Maidoc, having neither ox, horse nor ass, ordered
a sea-cow to come from the ocean, which she did and,
being harnessed to the plough, she furrowed his fields.
When St. Malo settled down near Saintes, the neighbours
made him a present of an ass, which was one day killed
by a wolf. St. Malo said to the wild beast, "Since
you have killed my ass you must serve me instead."
The wolf performed his duties admirably for many
years without a grumble. A similar story is told about
St. Santes of Urbino.</p>

<p>When St. Ronan was accused of being a vampire,
Grallo, King of Quimper, horrified to hear of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
monster, set dogs upon him to prove the truth of the
statement. As the savage animals rushed towards him
the saint raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross,
and said, "Stop! in the name of the Lord." The
animals became gentle at once and fawned on the saint.</p>

<p>There are legends of the souls of saints being borne
away by animals, of the souls of saints taking flight in the
shape of birds, of saints changing from one animal form
to another, of saints being approached by the devil in
the form of animals, and of saints being worshipped in
animal shape.</p>

<p>At the moment of the death of St. Vincent Ferrer,
the windows of his bedchamber opened of their own
accord and a number of winged creatures no larger than
butterflies, white in colour and very beautiful, flew into
the house. As the saint drew his last breath these
winged creatures disappeared suddenly, leaving a delightful
perfume behind them. Everyone was convinced
that the butterflies were angels who had come to carry
away the pure soul of the saint to paradise.</p>

<p>The same saint was said to be able to assume wings,
whenever he wished, and, in the form of a bird-angel,
to fly through the air in the hope of consoling and
comforting anyone who was in trouble and required his
assistance.</p>

<p>St. Benedict (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 480-543) was tempted by the devil
in the form of a blackbird. The saint had retired to a
cavern in Subiaco, about fifty miles west of Rome, and
the evil one resolved to do away with a holy man who
might prove a great enemy to his kingdom upon earth.
Taking the form of a bird, he hovered around the
hermit's dwelling-place, sometimes approaching so close
that the saint had only to put out his hand to touch the
bird. Becoming suspicious of the bird's motives,
however, St. Benedict made the sign of the cross and
the evil spirit vanished instantly.</p>

<p>St. Peter of Verona was also set upon by the devil,
this time in the shape of a horse. The holy man attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
large crowds to his church, and the devil, growing
jealous, rushed into the midst of the congregation in the
form of a black horse, stamping upon many present and
causing a panic of fear among the rest. The saint made
the sign of the cross and the phantom vanished in a cloud
of smoke.</p>

<p>Sometimes the devil appears to saints in the form of
a bull, and can work serious bodily harm, as in the case of
St. Catherine of Sweden, daughter of prince Ulpho, who
was brought up in the convent of Risburgh. The abbess
was at matins one morning and the devil, assuming the
form of a bull, tossed the child out of its cradle and left
her half-dead in the middle of the floor. The abbess
found her in this condition on her return, and the bull,
addressing the holy woman, cried, "I should certainly
have finished my work if God had permitted it," and
then he vanished. The devil, according to tradition, has
often been seen in the form of a dog,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and some of the
saints were annoyed by such phantoms.</p>

<p>Simon Magus, the sorcerer, sent unto Peter the
Apostle certain devils in the likeness of dogs to devour
him. St. Peter, "not looking for such currish guests,
consecrates certain morsels of bread and throws them to
the dog-devils, and by the power of that bread they are
all put to flight."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>When St. Stanislaus Kostka was preparing for admission
into the society of Jesus he was taken ill and the devil
appeared to him in the guise of a great black dog. The
demon took the sick man three times by the throat and
tried to throttle him, but Stanislaus after some difficulty
succeeded in driving him away by making the sign of the
cross.</p>

<p>Devils in the guise of rooks or crows annoyed St. Agnes
of Mount Pulciano by attacking her with beaks, claws,
and wings. The young girl with great presence of mind
invoked the name of the Saviour and the whole flock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
flew off.</p>

<p>St. Pascal Baylon, who lived from 1540-1592, was
assailed by devils in the guise of various animals. Sometimes
they rushed upon him in the form of lions and
tigers seeking to devour him. As he withstood their
attacks with wonderful courage they tried to get at him
in another way, and offered to impress upon his body the
marks of divine wounds, making crosses of blood on
various parts of his body. Then Pascal, horrified at this
form of deception, cried out to the evil one, "You
ravening wolf, how dare you take upon yourself the
clothing of a lamb? Away with you!" This speech
acted as an exorcism, and the devil vanished.</p>

<p>The evil one has often been likened to a ravening
wolf, which has led to the symbolic form of transformation
from a wolf to a lamb being found in many
legends&mdash;a mental change as extreme in its effects
as any physical change could be. Andrew Corcini,
afterwards Bishop of Fiesole, was converted in this
figurative sense from a wolf into a lamb. He was
the son of wealthy parents in Florence, and, shortly
after his birth, in 1302, his mother dreamt that she
had brought forth a wolf and that her wolfish offspring
ran into a church and became transformed into a
lamb. As the boy grew, his wolfish character was clearly
apparent; he was cruel, selfish, and untamable. One day
his mother said to him, "Andrew, you are in very truth
the child of my dream," and then she told him what she
thought of him. He was greatly struck by her story
and spent the night in solitude and prayer. The next
day he went to the church of the Carmelites and,
prostrating himself before the image of the Virgin, he
said, "Glorious Virgin, see the wolf full of iniquity at
thy feet. Thy offspring, oh mother, was a Lamb without
blemish. Make me also a lamb of God, and receive
me into the fold." For three hours he prayed without
ceasing, and then the prior found him and acceded to
his request to be taken into the Carmelite order, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
he became a changed man.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He died in 1373.</p>

<p>St. William of Acquitaine was also "converted from
a wolf to a lamb" (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1157). He was Count of Poitou
and Duke of Guyenne, a giant in stature and a wild
beast in disposition. Through the holy offices of St.
Bernard he became changed, and calling himself "the
chief of sinners" repented of his evil ways in sackcloth
and ashes.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>These cases of spiritual transformation from animal-man
to man-animal, though interesting psychologically,
do not awaken the intense curiosity which material
metamorphosis arouses, and which centres especially
in the subject of the wer-wolf.</p>

<p>Bodin<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> accumulated a large amount of evidence in
favour of actual transformation. He quotes one Pierre
Mamor, who, whilst in Savoy, deposed to having seen a
man change into a wolf and described how he did it.
Henry of Cologne, author of a treatise, "de Lamys,"
vouched for the truth of similar statements. Ulrich
le Meusnier, who dedicated a treatise to the Emperor
Sigismund, gave numerous examples of the veritability
of transformation, and swore to having seen a wer-wolf
at Constance, who was accused of and executed for this
crime. Germany, Greece, and Asia were much infested
by these pests. In 1542, under the rule of Sultan
Suleiman, a number of wer-wolves were found at Constantinople.
The Emperor called out the guard and,
marching forth at its head, freed the city of one hundred
and fifty of these terrors in full view of the people.</p>

<p>Paracelsus, one of the greatest occultists the world
has known, was positive that men could change into
animals. Gaspar Peucerus, who had long been sceptical
and thought such ideas were a fable, was constrained to
believe there was truth in certain stories brought to him
by merchants trading in Livonia, who had seen victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of lycanthropia executed for their misdeeds.</p>

<p>In the history of Johannus Trithemius, it may be read
that in the year 970 there was a Jew called Baian, son of
Simeon, who was not only able to turn into a wolf at
pleasure, but could also render himself invulnerable, and
Sigebertus, the historian, wrote that one of the Kings
of Bulgaria was able to transform himself into all kinds
of animals.</p>

<p>Boguet, if anything, erred on the side of credulity.
He asserted that in 1148 a huge man-wolf was seen at
Geneva, which killed thirty people.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In July, 1603, in the district of Douvres and Jeurre
a great storm of hail fell and damaged all the fruit trees,
and three mysterious wolves were seen. They had no
tails, and they passed harmlessly through a herd of cows
and goats, touching none of them except one kid, which
one of the wolves carried to a distance without in any
way injuring it. This unnatural conduct made it fairly
evident that these were not real wolves, but sorcerers
who had brought about the hail-storm and wished to
visit the scene of the disaster. It was said that the biggest
wolf that led the pack must be the evil one himself.</p>

<p>The two stories which follow show that transformation
was sometimes regarded as an instrument of divine
punishment for sins committed.</p>

<p>Albertus Pericofcius in Muscovy treated his subjects
with gross cruelty, and extorted herds and flocks from
them. One night he was away from home and all his
cattle were killed. When informed of his loss he swore
a round oath, saying, "Let him who has slain, eat; if
the Lord chooses, let him devour me as well."</p>

<p>At his words some drops of blood fell to the ground,
he was transformed into a wild dog, and rushing upon
his dead cattle began to devour the carcases.</p>

<p>Another gentleman in the vicinity of Prague who had
robbed his tenants right and left took the last cow from
a widow who had five children to support. As a judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
he lost all his cattle, at which misfortune he broke
into horrible curses. He was there and then transformed
into a dog which had a human head.</p>

<p>These incidents, however, throw no light on the real
nature of the wer-wolf or wer-dog, which remains as
much a mystery as that of the vampire. In some points
a similarity may be said to exist between them, both being
destructive forces, of an evil and self-seeking character.
Those afflicted become subject to trance-like states and
hysterical phenomena.</p>

<p>A certain kind of vampire (which is really a bloodsucking
ghost) is said to have the power of assuming
animal shape, and Bulgarian vampires appear to be
especially gifted with this peculiarity.</p>

<p>It is believed in a certain district of Germany that unless
money is placed in the mouth of a corpse at the time
of burial, or if the dead man's name is not cut from his
shirt, he will become a vampire and his ghost will issue
from his grave in the form of a pig.</p>

<p>A gruesome story is told of a witch who chose to wander
in animal shape. She died in 1345 and her body was
cast rudely into a ditch, but instead of resting quietly
she roamed at night in the form of various unclean
beasts, leaving havoc and death in her tracks. On
exhumation she was found to be a vampire, and a stake
was driven through her breast, which, however, failed
to have the desired effect. She still prowled around in
the dark, using the stake as a weapon with which to slay
her victims, nor did she cease her nefarious deeds until
her body had been reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>Camden says that jilted maidens or deserted wives
used to bribe witches to get their faithless men consigned
to prison for lycanthropy, the usual term being
seven years, but, judging from the trials which are on
record, death by burning was more frequently resorted
to.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
THE WER-WOLF TRIALS</h3>


<p>In Poitou the peasants have a curious expression, "courir
la galipote," which means to turn into a wer-wolf or
other human-animal by night and chase prey through
the woods. The <i>galipote</i> is the familiar or imp which
the sorcerer has the power to send forth.</p>

<p>In the dark ages sorcerers capable of this accomplishment
were dealt with according to the law, and hundreds
were sent to trial for practising black arts, being condemned,
in most instances, to be burnt alive or broken
on the wheel. One of the most notorious historical cases
was that of Pierre Bourgot, who served the devil for two
years and was tried by the Inquisitor-General Boin.</p>

<p>Johannus Wierius<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> gives in full the confession of Bourgot,
otherwise called Great Peter, and of Michael Verding.
The prisoners, who were accused of wicked practices
in December, 1521, believed they had been transformed
into wolves.</p>

<p>About nineteen years before Pierre's arrest at Pouligny
a dreadful storm occurred which scattered the flock of
sheep of which he was shepherd, and while he went far
afield to search for them he met three black horsemen,
one of whom said to him, "Where are you going, my
friend? You appear to be in trouble."</p>

<p>Pierre told him that he was seeking his sheep, and the
horseman bade him take courage, saying that if he would
only have faith, his master would protect the straying
sheep and see that no harm came to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Pierre thanked him and promised to meet him again
in the same place a few days later. Soon afterwards he
found the stray sheep.</p>

<p>The black horseman, at their second meeting, told
Pierre that he served the devil, and Pierre agreed to do
likewise if he promised him protection for his flock.
Then the devil's servant made him renounce God, the
Virgin Mary, and all the saints of Paradise, his baptism
and the tenets of Christianity. Pierre swore that he
would do so, and kissed the horseman's left hand, which
was as black as ink and felt stone-cold. Then he knelt
down and took an oath of allegiance to the devil, and
the horseman forbade him thenceforth to repeat the
Apostles' creed.</p>

<p>For two years Pierre remained in the service of the
evil one, and during that time he never entered a church
until mass was over, or at least until after the holy water
had been sprinkled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his flock was kept in perfect safety, and
this sense of security made him so indifferent about the
devil that he began to go to church again and to say the
creed. This went on for eight or nine years, when he
was told by one Michael Verding that he must once
more render obedience to the evil one, his master. In
return for his homage Pierre was told that he would
receive a sum of money.</p>

<p>Michael led him one evening to a clearing in the woods
at Chastel Charlon, where many strangers were dancing.
Each performer held in his hand a green torch which
emitted a blue flame. Michael told Pierre to bestir
himself and that then he would receive payment, so
Pierre threw off his clothes and Michael smeared his
body with an ointment which he carried. Pierre believed
that he had been transformed into a wolf, and was horrified
to find that he had four paws and a thick pelt. He
found himself able to run with the speed of the wind.
Michael had also made use of the salve and had become
equally agile. After an hour or two they resumed human
shape, their respective masters giving them another salve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
for this purpose. After this experience Pierre complained
that he felt utterly weary, and his master told him that
was of no consequence and that he would be speedily
restored to his usual state of health.</p>

<p>Pierre was often transformed into a wer-wolf after
this first attempt, and on one occasion he fell upon a boy
of seven with the intention of killing and eating him, but
the child screamed so loudly that he beat a hasty retreat
to the spot where his clothes lay in a heap, rubbed himself
hurriedly with the ointment and resumed human form
to escape capture. Another time Michael and he killed
an old woman who was gathering peas, and one day
whilst in the shape of wolves they devoured the whole
of a little girl except for one arm, and Michael said her
flesh tasted excellent, although it apparently gave
Pierre indigestion. They confessed also to strangling a
young woman, whose blood they drank.</p>

<p>Among other disgusting crimes, Pierre murdered a
girl of eight in a garden by cracking her neck between his
jaws, and he killed a goat near to the farm of one Master
Pierre Lerugen, first by setting on it with his teeth and
then by gashing its throat with a knife. The latter
operation leads to the belief that he had resumed his
ordinary shape at the time.</p>

<p>A peculiar point worth noticing about the case of
Michael and Pierre was that the former was able to
transform himself at any moment with his clothes on,
while the latter had to strip and rub in ointment to achieve
the same result. At the time of his confession Pierre
declared that he could not recollect where the wolf's
fur went to when he became human again.</p>

<p>He also deposed that an ash-coloured powder was given
to him, which he rubbed upon his arms and left hand
and thus caused the death of every animal he touched.
Here there would seem to be some discrepancy, for he
declared that in many instances he strangled, bit, or
wounded his victims!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Garinet<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> gives a good account of the important trial
in 1573 of Gilles Garnier, who was arrested for having
devoured several children whilst in the form of a wer-wolf.</p>

<p>The prisoner was accused of seizing a young girl aged
ten or twelve in a vineyard near Dôle, of killing her and
dragging her into a wood, and of tearing the flesh from
her bones with his teeth and claws. He found this food
so palatable that he carried some of it away with him
and offered to share it with his wife. A week after the
feast of All Saints he captured another young girl near
the village of La Pouppé, and was about to slay and
devour her when someone hastened to her rescue and
he took flight.</p>

<p>A week later, being still in the form of a wolf, he had
killed and eaten a boy at a spot between Gredisans and
Menoté, about a league from Dôle. He was accused also
of being in the shape of a man when he caught another
boy of twelve or thirteen years of age and carried him
into the wood to strangle him, and, "in spite of the fact
that it was Friday," he would have devoured his flesh
had he not been interrupted by the approach of some
strangers, who were too late, however, to save the boy's
life. Garnier, having admitted all the charges against
him, the judge pronounced the following sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The condemned man is to be dragged to the place
of execution and there burnt alive and his body reduced
to ashes."</p>

<p>The account of the trial, which took place on the 18th
day of January, 1573, was accompanied by a letter from
Daniel d'Ange to the Dean of the Church of Sens which
contained the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gilles Garnier, lycophile, as I may call him, lived
the life of a hermit, but has since taken a wife, and having
no means of support for his family fell into the way, as
is natural to defiant and desperate people of rude habits,
of wandering into the woods and wild places. In this
state he was met by a phantom in the shape of a man, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
told him that he could perform miracles, among other
things declaring that he would teach him how to change
at will into a wolf, lion, or leopard, and because the wolf
is more familiar in this country than the other kinds of
wild beasts he chose to disguise himself in that shape,
which he did, using a salve with which he rubbed himself
for this purpose, as he has since confessed before dying,
after recognising the evil of his ways."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The affair made such a stir in the neighbourhood, and
the dread of wer-wolves had risen to such a pitch, that
it was found necessary to ask the help of the populace
in suppressing the nuisance. A legal decree was issued
which empowered the people at Dôle to "assemble with
javelins, pikes, arquebuses, and clubs to hunt and pursue
the wer-wolf, and to take, bind, and kill it without
incurring the usual fine or penalty for indulging in the
chase without permission."</p>

<p>Boguet is the authority who cites the following cases
of lycanthropy:<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>A boy called Benedict, aged about fifteen, one day
climbed a tree to gather some fruit, when he saw a wolf
attacking his little sister, who was playing at the foot of
the tree.</p>

<p>The boy climbed down quickly, and the animal,
which was tailless, let go of the little girl and turned upon
her brother, who defended himself with a knife. According
to the boy's account, the wolf tore the knife out of
his hand and struck at his throat. A neighbour ran to
the rescue and carried the boy home, where he died a
few days after from the wound. Whilst he lay dying
he declared that the wolf which had injured him had
fore-paws shaped like human hands, but that its hind
feet were covered with fur.</p>

<p>After inquiry it was proved that a young and demented
girl called Perrenette Gandillon believed herself to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
wolf and had done this horrible deed. She was caught
by the populace and torn limb from limb. This case
occurred in the Jura mountains in 1598.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Perrenette's brother Pierre was
accused of being a wer-wolf, and confessed that he had
been to the witches' Sabbath in this form. His son
George had also been anointed with salve and had killed
goats whilst he was in animal shape. Antoinette, his
sister, was accused of sorcery and of intercourse with the
devil, who appeared to her in the form of a black goat.
Several members of the Gandillon family were arrested,
and in prison Pierre and George conducted themselves
as though they were possessed, walking on all fours and
howling like wild beasts.</p>

<p>Not long after the Gandillon family had been disposed
of, one Jeanne Perrin gave evidence that she was walking
near a wood with her friend Clauda Gaillard, who
disappeared suddenly behind a bush, and that the next
moment there came forth a tailless wolf which frightened
her so much that she made the sign of the cross and ran
away. She was sure that the hind legs of the wolf were
like human limbs. When Clauda saw her again she
assured Jeanne that the wolf had not meant to do her
harm, and from this it was thought that Clauda had
taken the shape of the wolf.</p>

<p>One of the best known of the wer-wolf trials concerns
Jacques Rollet, the man-wolf of Caude, who was accused
of having devoured a little boy.</p>

<p>He was tried and condemned in Angers in 1598.
Rollet came from the parish of Maumusson, near to
Nantes, and he carried on his practices in a desolate spot
near Caude, where some villagers one day found the
corpse of a boy of about fifteen, mangled and blood-bespattered.
As they approached the body three wolves
bounded into the forest and were lost to sight, but the
men gave chase, and following in the animals' tracks,
came suddenly upon a half-naked human being, with
long hair and beard, his hands covered with blood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
his teeth chattering with fear. On his claw-like nails
they found shreds of human flesh.</p>

<p>This miserable specimen of man-animal was hauled
up before the judge, and under examination he inquired
of one of the witnesses whether he remembered shooting
at three wolves. The witness said he remembered the
incident perfectly. Rollet confessed that he was one of
the wolves and that he was able to transform himself by
means of a salve. The other wolves were his companions,
Jean and Julian, who knew the same means of
acquiring animal shape. All the particulars he gave as
to the murder were accurate, and he confessed to having
killed and eaten women, lawyers, attorneys, and bailiffs,
though the last-named he found tough and tasteless.
In other respects his evidence was confused, and he was
judged to be of weak intellect, and though condemned
to death was sent finally to a madhouse, where he was
sentenced to two years' detention.</p>

<p>There was an epidemic of lycanthropy throughout this
year, and on the 4th of December a tailor of Châlons
was burnt in Paris for having decoyed children into his
shop, a cask full of human bones being discovered in the
cellar. For the space of a few years no notorious wer-wolf
trials appear to have taken place, but the year 1603
was almost as prolific in this respect as 1598.</p>

<p>Information came before the criminal court at Roche
Chalais that a wild beast was ravaging the district, that
it appeared to be a wolf, and that it had attacked a
young girl called Margaret Poiret in full daylight.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>A youth of thirteen or fourteen in the service of Peter
Combaut deposed to the fact that he had thrown himself
upon the said Margaret, whilst transformed into a
wolf, and that he would have devoured her had she not
defended herself stoutly with a stick. He also confessed
to having eaten two or three little girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidence was given on May 29th, 1603, by three
witnesses, one of whom was Margaret herself. She said
she had been accustomed to mind cattle in the company
of the boy, Jean Grenier, and that he had often frightened
her by telling her horrible tales about being able to change
into a wolf whenever he wished, and that he had killed
many dogs and sucked their blood, but that he preferred
to devour young children. He said he had recently
killed a child, and after eating part of her flesh had thrown
the rest to a companion wolf.</p>

<p>Margaret described the beast which had attacked her as
stouter and shorter than a real wolf, with a smaller head,
a short tail, and reddish hide. After she struck at it,
the animal drew back and sat down on its haunches like
a dog, at a distance of about twelve paces. Its look was
so ferocious that she ran away at once.</p>

<p>The third witness was Jeanne Gaboriaut, who was
eighteen years old. She gave evidence that one day,
when she was tending cattle in company with other
girls, Jean Grenier came up and asked which was the most
beautiful shepherdess amongst them. Jeanne asked him
why he wanted to know. He said because he wished to
marry the prettiest, and if it was Jeanne he would choose
her.</p>

<p>Jeanne said, "Who is your father?" and he told her
that he was the son of a priest.</p>

<p>Then she replied that he was too dark in appearance
for her taste, and when he answered he had been like
that for a long time, she asked him whether he had
turned black from cold or whether he had been burnt
black.</p>

<p>He said the cause was a wolf's skin he was wearing,
which had been given to him by one Pierre Labourant,
and when he wore it he could turn into a wolf at will
or any other animal he preferred, and he went on with
details similar to those he had disclosed to Margaret
Poiret.</p>

<p>It was proved, however, that Grenier was not the son
of a priest, but of a labourer, Pierre Grenier, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
lived in the parish of St. Antoine de Pizan.</p>

<p>When questioned as to his crimes, he confessed to the
assault upon Margaret Poiret as described by her, and
also that he had entered a house in the guise of a wolf,
and finding no one there but a babe in its cradle he
seized it by the throat and carried it behind a hedge in
the garden, where he ate as much of the body as he could
and threw the remainder to another wolf.</p>

<p>At St. Antoine de Pizan he attacked a girl in a black
dress who was tending sheep, and he killed and devoured
her, a strange point being that her dress was not torn,
as happens in the case when real wolves make the assault.</p>

<p>When questioned as to how he managed to turn into
a wolf, he said that a neighbour, called Pierre la Tilhaire,
had introduced him in the forest to the Lord thereof,
who had given wolf-skins to both, as well as a salve for
anointing themselves. When asked where he kept the
skins and the pot of ointment he replied that they were
in the hands of the Lord of the Forest, from whom he
could obtain them whenever he wished.</p>

<p>He declared that he had changed into a wolf and gone
coursing four times with his companion Pierre la Tilhaire,
but they had killed no one. The best time for the hunt
was an hour or two a day when the moon was on the wane,
but he also went out at night on some occasions.</p>

<p>When asked whether his father knew of these proceedings,
he replied in the affirmative, and declared that
his father had rubbed him three times with the ointment
and helped him into the wolf's skin.</p>

<p>The inquiry into Jean Grenier's case was a very
lengthy one and was adjourned several times, but
eventually he was sentenced to imprisonment for life
at Bordeaux on September 6th, 1603, his youth and want
of mental development being pleaded in extenuation of
the crimes of infanticide he had undoubtedly committed.
The president of the Court declared that lycanthropy
was a form of hallucination and was not in itself
a punishable crime. Jean's father was acquitted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
complicity, and allowed to leave the court without a
stain on his character, and Jean was sent to a monastery.</p>

<p>In 1610, after Jean had been at the Monastery of the
Cordeliers in Bordeaux for seven years, De Lancre, who
relates his story, went to see him. He was then about
twenty years of age and of diminutive stature. His
black eyes were haggard and deep-set, and he refused to
look anyone straight in the face. His teeth were long,
sharp, and protruding, his nails were also long and black,
and his mind was a mere blank.</p>

<p>He told De Lancre, not without pride, that he had
been a wer-wolf, but that he had given up the practice.
When he first arrived at the monastery he had preferred
to go on all fours, eating such food as he found on the
ground. He confessed that he still craved for raw human
flesh, especially the flesh of little girls, and he hoped it
would not be long before he had another opportunity
of tasting it. He had been visited twice during his
confinement by the Lord of the Forest, as he called the
mysterious person who had given him the wolf-skin, but
that both times he had made the sign of the cross and
his visitor had departed in haste.</p>

<p>In other respects his tale was identical with the experiences
he had related before the court.</p>

<p>De Lancre thought that the name Grenier or Garnier
was a fatal name in connection with wer-wolves.</p>

<p>Evidence was given as to the times, places, and number
of murders, and many of the facts were proved incontestably.</p>

<p>Jean's evidence as to the part his father had played
in his misdeeds was hazy. He said that on one occasion
his father had accompanied him, also wearing a wolf-skin,
and that together they had killed a young girl dressed in
white, and that they had devoured her flesh, the month
being May of 1601.</p>

<p>He also added curious details regarding the Lord of
the Forest, who had forbidden him to bite the thumbnail
of his left hand, which was thicker and longer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the others, and that if he lost sight of it while in the form
of a wolf he would quickly recover his human shape.</p>

<p>When confronted with his father Jean altered some
of the details of his story, and it was agreed that long
imprisonment and extended cross-examination had worn
out his already feeble intellect.</p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that in the cases of Rollet,
the tailor of Châlons, and the Gandillon family, the
prisoners were accused of murder and cannibalism, but
not of association with wolves, and that in the trial of
Garnier evidence was given as to the depredations of the
wolf rather than of the accused. There was doubtless
a difficulty in proving the identity of the perpetrator
of the murders.</p>

<p>A new era in these trials begins with that of Jean
Grenier, for from that time onward medical men became
more enlightened, and the belief spread that lycanthropy
was a mental malady, with cannibalistic tendencies
which had developed under diseased conditions.</p>

<p>In his "Dæmonologie," 1597, a reply to Reginald
Scott's "Discovery of Witchcraft," James I of England
declared that wer-wolves were victims of a delusion
induced by a state of melancholia, and about the same
period wolves became practically extinct in England,
and only harmless creatures such as the cat, hare, and
weasel were left for the sorcerer to change into with any
possibility of a safe and natural disguise.</p>

<p>For many years afterwards the confessions of witches,
who were executed for their crimes, bore striking
resemblance to those made by wer-wolves, and many
strange facts which were published at these trials have
never been, and may never be, satisfactorily explained
on a purely materialistic basis.</p>

THE WER-WOLF IN MYTH AND LEGEND</h3>


<p>An extraordinary story about a wer-wolf comes from
Ansbach in 1685:</p>

<p>The supposed incarnation of a dead burgomaster of
that town was said to be ravishing the neighbouring
country in the form of a wolf, devouring cattle as well
as women and children. At last the ferocious beast was
caught and slaughtered, and its carcass was encased in
a suit of flesh-coloured cere-cloth, while its head and face
were adorned with a chestnut-coloured wig and long
white beard, after the animal's snout had been cut off
and a mask resembling the dead burgomaster's features
had been substituted. This effigy was hanged, its skin
stuffed and put in a museum, where it was pointed out
as a proof of the actual existence of wer-wolves. This
incident appears to prove that the belief in wer-wolves
had been shaken at that date, but it has never been
finally eradicated, and it is only natural that a theme
which has had such world-wide credence should occur
again and again in mythology and literature. It is
dealt with in the story of the festival of the god Zeus,
which was held every nine years on the Wolf mountain
in Arcadia. During the banquet a man, having tasted
of a flowing bowl in which human and animal flesh were
mixed, was turned into a wolf and remained a wolf
nine years. If he had abstained from eating human flesh
in the interval he became once more a man. The tradition
appears to have originated in the existence of a
society of cannibal wolf-worshippers, a member of which
perhaps represented the sacred animal for nine years in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
succession.</p>

<p>This compares in some degree with the practices of
the Human Leopard Society, which is of comparatively
recent origin.</p>

<p>Lycaon, the King of Arcadia and father of Callisto,
was turned into a wolf because he offered human sacrifices
to Jupiter, or, in the version given by Ovid, because
he tried to murder Jupiter, who was his guest. Others
believe that Lycaon is the Constellation of the Wolf,
and that in him were the united qualities of wolf, king,
and constellation.</p>

<p>Pliny points out that the origin of transformation
into wolves was due to Evanthes, a Greek author of
good repute, who tells the story of Antheus, the Arcadian,
a member of whose family is chosen by lot and then taken
to a certain lake in the district, across which he swims and
is changed into a wolf for a space of nine years. So, too,
Demæntus, during a sacrifice of human victims, tasted
the entrails of a boy who had been slaughtered, upon
which he turned into a wolf, but ten years later he was
victorious in the pugilistic contests at the Olympic
games.</p>

<p>The following quaint story is taken from Petronius,
being told by one Niceros, at a banquet given by
Trimalchio.</p>

<p>"It happened that my master was gone to Capua to
dispose of some second-hand goods. I took the opportunity
and persuaded our guest to walk with me to our
fifth milestone. He was a valiant soldier, and a sort of
a grim water-drinking Pluto. About cock-crow, when the
moon was shining as bright as midday, we came amongst
the monuments. My friend began addressing himself
to the stars, but I was rather in a mood to sing or count
them; and when I turned to look at him, lo! he had
already stripped himself and laid his clothes near him.
My heart was in my nostrils, and I stood like a dead
man; but he made a mark round his clothes and on a
sudden became a wolf. Do not think I jest, I would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
lie for any man's estate. But to return to what I am
saying. When he became a wolf he began howling and
fled into the woods. At first I hardly knew where I was,
and afterwards, when I went to take up his clothes,
they were turned into stone. Who then was more like
to die from fear than I? Yet I drew my sword, and
cutting the air right and left came thus to my sweetheart's
house. When I entered the courtyard I was like
to breathe my last, perspiration poured from my neck,
and my eyes were dim. My Melissa met me to ask where
I had been so late, and said, 'Had you only come sooner
you might have helped us, for a wolf came to the farm
and worried our cattle; but he had not the best of the
joke, for all he escaped, as our servant ran a lance through
his neck.' When I heard this I could not doubt what had
happened, and as the day dawned I ran home as fast as
a robbed innkeeper. When I came to the spot where the
clothes had been turned into stone I could find nothing
except blood. But when I got home I found my friend,
the soldier, in bed, bleeding at the neck like an ox, and
a doctor dressing his wound. I then knew he was a
turnskin; nor would I ever have broken bread with him
again, no not if you had killed me."</p>

<p>The expression turnskin or turncoat is a translation
of the Latin <i>versipelles</i>, a term used to describe a
wer-wolf.</p>

<p>Another story in which the human being suffers from
the wound inflicted on the wer-wolf concerns a fine lady
of Saintonge, who used to wander at night in the forests
in the shape of a wolf. One day she caught her paw in
a trap set by the hunters. This put an end to her
nocturnal wanderings, and afterwards she had to keep
a glove on the hand that had been trapped, to conceal
the mutilation of two of her fingers.</p>

<p>Eliphas Levi, the occultist, has endeavoured to explain
this sympathetic condition between the man and his
animal presentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must speak here of lycanthropy, or the nocturnal
transformation of men into wolves, histories so well
substantiated that sceptical science has had recourse to
furious maniacs, and to masquerading as animals for
explanations. But such hypotheses are puerile and explain
nothing. Let us seek elsewhere the solution of
the mystery, and establish&mdash;First, that no person has
been killed by a wer-wolf except by suffocation, without
effusion of blood and without wounds. Second, that
wer-wolves, though tracked, hunted, and even maimed,
have never been killed on the spot. Third, that persons
suspected of these transformations have always been
found at home, after the pursuit of the wer-wolf, more
or less wounded, sometimes dying, but invariably in
their natural form....</p>

<p>"We have spoken of the sidereal body, which is the
mediator between the soul and the material organism.
This body remains awake very often while the other is
asleep, and by thought transports itself through all space
which universal magnetism opens to it. It thus lengthens,
without breaking, the sympathetic chain attaching it to
the heart and brain, and that is why there is danger in
waking up dreaming persons with a start, for the shock
may sever the chain at a blow and cause instantaneous
death. The form of our sidereal body is conformable to
the habitual condition of our thoughts, and in the long
run it is bound to modify the features of the material
organism. Let us now be bold enough to assert that the
wer-wolf is nothing more than the sidereal body of a man
whose savage and sanguinary instincts are represented
by the wolf, who, whilst his phantom is wandering
abroad, sleeps painfully in his bed, and dreams that he is
a veritable wolf. What renders the wer-wolf visible is
the almost somnambulistic over-excitement caused by
the fear of those who see it, or their disposition, more
particularly among simple country-folk, to place themselves
in direct communication with the astral light
which is the common medium of dreams and visions.
The blows inflicted on the wer-wolf really wound the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
sleeper by the odic and sympathetic conjestion of the
astral light and by the correspondence of the immaterial
with the material body...."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>This peculiarity of the wound dealt to the wer-wolf
being reproduced in the human being is emphasised by
an incident which occurred about 1588 in a tiny village
situated in the mountains of Auvergne. A gentleman
was gazing one evening from the windows of his castle
when he saw a hunter he knew passing on his way to the
chase. Calling to him, he begged that on his return he
would report what luck he had had. The hunter after
pursuing his way was attacked by a large wolf. He fired
off his gun without hitting the animal. Then he struck
at it with his hunting knife, severing one of the paws,
which he picked up and put in his knapsack. The
wounded wolf ran quickly into the forest. When the
hunter reached the castle he told his friend of his strange
fight with a wolf, and to emphasise his story opened his
knapsack, in which to his horror and surprise he saw, not
a wolf's paw as he had expected, but the hand of a woman
which had a gold ring on one of the fingers.</p>

<p>The owner recognised the ring as belonging to his
wife, and hastening into the kitchen to question her he
found her with one arm hidden beneath the folds of a
shawl. He drew it aside and saw she had lost her hand.
Then she confessed that it was she who, in the form of
a wolf, had attacked the hunter. She was arrested and
burnt to death soon afterwards at Ryon.</p>

<p>In another variation of the wer-wolf story, the human
being retains a material object acquired by his animal
replica and is freed thereby from his obsession.</p>

<p>A man, who from his childhood had been a wer-wolf,
when returning one night with his wife from a merrymaking,
observed that the hour was at hand when the
transformation usually took place. Giving the reins to his
wife, he got out of the cart and said, "If anyone comes
to thee, strike at it with thy apron." Then he went away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and a few minutes later the poor woman was attacked
by a wolf. Remembering what her husband had told
her, she struck at it with her apron, and the animal tore
out a piece and ran off. Presently the man himself
returned holding in his mouth the torn fragment of the
apron. Then his wife cried out in terror, "Good Lord,
man! Why, thou art a wer-wolf!" "Thank thee,
mother!" replied he, "but now I am free!" and after
this incident he kept human form until the day of his
death.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In "William of Palermo," the old romance known as
"William and the Wer-Wolf," translated from the
French at the command of Sir Humphrey de Bohun
about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1350,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> the wer-wolf appears as a sort of a
guardian angel. The brother of the King Apulia,
envious of the heir-apparent, bribes two women to
murder the king's son. While the boy William is at play
a wer-wolf runs off with him, swims across the Straits of
Messina, and carries him into a forest near Rome, where
it takes care of him and provides him with food. The
wer-wolf in reality is Alphonso, heir to the Spanish
throne, who has been transformed by his stepmother
Queen Braunde, who desires her own son Braundinis to
wear the crown of Spain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wer-wolf embraces the king's son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his fore-feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so familiar with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the king's son, that all pleases him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever the beast does for him.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While the wer-wolf seeks provender, a cowherd finds
William and takes him to his hut, where the Emperor
meets him when out hunting. Placing him behind him
on his horse he takes him to Rome and gives him in
charge of his daughter Melior, to be her page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>William and Melior fall in love with one another, and
to avoid the Emperor's wrath devise an escape, disguised
in the skins of white bears, helped by Melior's friend
Alexandrine. When Melior asks whether she makes a
bold bear, Alexandrine answers, "Yes, Madame, you
are a grisly ghost enough, and look ferocious." Together
the lovers wander out of the garden on all fours and
making their way to the forest hide in a den. Meanwhile
the wer-wolf has followed William's fortunes, and finding
the wanderers in need, he sets on a harmless passer-by
who carries provisions, and seizing bread and boiled beef
out of his bag, lays it before the lovers, then runs off
and, attacking another traveller, secures two flagons of
wine.</p>

<p>Being pursued, the lovers escape to Palermo, led
always by the wer-wolf, Alphonso, half-brother to
Braundinis, who was destined by Melior's father to
become his son-in-law. William does battle with the
proposed suitor and, still helped by the wer-wolf, whose
symbol is painted on his shield, overcomes his rival, takes
the King and Queen of Spain prisoner and refuses to
let them go until Queen Braunde promises to transform
the rightful heir from a wolf back into a human being.
"Unless she disenchants you, she shall be burnt," he
says forcibly. Braunde takes her stepson, the wolf,
into a private chamber, draws forth a magic ring with a
stone in it that is proof against all witchcraft and binds
it with a red silk thread round the wolf's neck. Then
she takes a book out of a casket and reads in it a long
time till he turns into a man. The wer-wolf is delighted,
but apologises to his stepmother for having no clothes
on, and she commands him to choose who shall fetch his
clothes. He answers that he will take his attire and the
order of knighthood from the worthiest man alive,
William of Palermo. William, being called, enters the
chamber, where he sees a man who is an utter stranger
and is only satisfied when he hears Alphonso's explanation,
"I am the wer-wolf who saved you from many
perils." William and Melior are married, all ends happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and William becomes Emperor of Rome.</p>

<p>The Bretons give the name of Bisclavaret to the wer-wolf,
or wer-fox, which throws itself upon the hunter's
horse and terrorises it. The same thing is called Garwal
by the Normans. Bisclavaret is supposed to be a wizard,
and if in olden times an unknown lady offered food to
the hunters at the moment the animal appeared she was
thought to be a witch.</p>

<p>Marie de France in her "Lay of the Bisclavaret" used
the idea of a wer-wolf, and again in this case the animal
has no savage instincts except against his enemies, a
faithless wife and her perfidious lover.</p>

<p>A gallant knight of Brittany, a favourite with the
king, weds a fair lady whom he loves tenderly. Only one
cloud darkens the wife's horizon. Her husband leaves
her invariably three days a week and she does not know
where he goes. One day she has the temerity to ask
him, and he warns her that the information may be
dangerous, but when she pleads with him he says:</p>

<p>"Learn then that I become a wer-wolf during my
absence. I go into the forest, hide in the thickets and
seek my prey."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, tell me whether you take off your
clothes," says the wife, "or whether you keep them on?"</p>

<p>"I am naked when the transformation occurs,
Madame."</p>

<p>"And where do you leave your clothes?"</p>

<p>"I must not tell you, because if I were seen when I
take them off I should remain a wer-wolf for the rest of
my life. I can only recover human form at the moment
I put them on again. After that you will not be surprised
if I say no more." But she urges him to tell her,
and finally he says that he hides his clothes under a bush
near an old stone cross in the corner of a chapel, and
there he puts them on when he wishes to resume his
original shape.</p>

<p>Frightened by his awful story the wife decides to live
with him no more and immediately sends for a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
man who is in love with her, tells him the story and
enjoins him to go and take away her husband's clothes.
Thus she betrays her husband, the wer-wolf, who does
not return and is given up for dead, and some time after
she marries her false lover.</p>

<p>About a year later the king goes on a hunting expedition
in the forest. There he comes across the wer-wolf, and
the hounds immediately take up the scent and give chase
the whole day long. Wounded by the hunters and
wearied nigh unto death, the wolf seizes the bridle of
the king's horse and licks his majesty's foot. The king,
in great fear, calls his companions to look at the extraordinary
wild beast that is capable of this humble action.
He refuses to allow the wolf to be slaughtered and takes
it back, in his train, to the castle. There the wolf lives
in great comfort like a domestic pet and harms no one.</p>

<p>Presently a great function is held at the court and
the wer-wolf's former wife comes there with her new
husband. The moment the wolf sets eyes on him he
springs at his throat, and would surely have killed him
had not the king beaten him off with a whip. For the
rest of the gentleman's visit the wolf is kept under strict
discipline.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards, the king, accompanied by his
faithful wolf, pays a visit to the lady, and the animal
springs at her ferociously and bites off her nose. Then
the courtiers say that the matter must be inquired into,
for the wolf only turns savage when in the presence of
this lady and her new husband. The king decides to
have the couple arrested and the lady has to confess
what happened, saying she thinks the wer-wolf must
be her transformed husband. After hearing her story
the king orders the wer-wolf's clothes to be placed where
he can get them privately, and after waiting outside the
room in which the metamorphosis is to take place, for
some time, he enters and finds the former knight, his
old friend whom he thought dead, lying quietly asleep.
He restores all his honours and has his faithless wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
chased out of the kingdom in company with her false
lover. All their daughters are born without noses as a
punishment for the wicked fraud practised on the wer-wolf.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Olaus Magnus<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> declares that although the inhabitants
of Prussia, Livonia, and Lithuania suffer considerably
from the depredations of wolves as far as their cattle
are concerned, their losses are not so serious in this
quarter as those they suffer at the hands of wer-wolves.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve multitudes of wer-wolves gather
at a certain spot and band together to attack human
beings and animals. They besiege isolated houses, break
in the doors and devour every living thing. They burst
into the beer-cellars and there empty the casks, thus
proving their human tastes. A ruined castle near
Courland appears to have been their favourite meeting-place,
where thousands congregate in order to test their
agility. If any of them fail to bound over the castle
wall they are slain by the others, as they are considered
in that case to be incompetent for the work in hand.</p>

<p>It is believed that a messenger in the person of a lame
youth is sent round the neighbourhood to call these
followers of the devil to a general conclave. Those who
are reluctant to attend the meeting are beaten with
iron scourges. When the gathering is assembled the
human forms vanish and the whole multitude become
wolves. The troops follow the leader, "firmly convinced
in their imagination that they are transformed
into wolves." The sorcery lasts for twelve days, and
at the expiration of this period the human forms are
resumed.</p>

<p>Referring further to these Courland wer-wolves, it is
said of them that Satan holds them in his net in three
ways. Firstly they execute certain depredations, such
as mangling cattle, in their human shapes, but in such a
state of hallucination that they believe themselves to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
wolves and are regarded as such by others in a like
predicament. Though not true wer-wolves they hunt in
packs. Secondly they leave their bodies lying asleep and
send forth their imagination in a dream that they believe
they have injured the cattle, but that it is the devil who
does what is suggested to them by their thoughts, and
thirdly that the evil one induces real wolves to do the
horrid deeds, but impresses the scene so vividly on the
mind of the sleeper that he considers himself to be guilty
of the act.</p>

<p>The following stories exemplify these conditions.
The first is told of a man who when starting on a journey
saw a wolf attacking one of his sheep. He fired and it
fled wounded into the thicket. On his return he was
told that he had fired at one of his tenants, called Mickel.</p>

<p>Mickel's wife, when questioned, said that her husband
had been sowing rye and had asked her how he could get
some meat for a feast. She said on no account was he
to steal from the master's flock as it was well guarded by
dogs. Mickel ignored her advice and had attacked the
sheep. He came home limping badly and in a passion
had fallen upon his own horse and had torn its throat.
It seemed as though he were bewitched or in a trance.</p>

<p>In 1684 a curious incident occurred to a man who had
gone hunting in a forest. At dusk a pack of wolves had
rushed towards him, and as he levelled his gun with the
intention of aiming at the leader a voice arose from their
midst, saying, "Don't fire, Sir, for no good will come
of it." Then the phantom pack rushed onwards and he
saw it no more.</p>

<p>The third story is about a man-wolf who was accused
of sorcery of the most flagrant kind. Finding a difficulty
in getting evidence against the criminal, the judge sent a
peasant to his cell who was charged with the unpleasant
task of forcing a confession. The prisoner was told that
he might avenge himself upon another peasant to whom
he owed a grudge, by destroying his cow secretly, and if
possible when in the shape of a wolf himself. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
much persuasion the supposed wer-wolf undertook to
carry out the suggested plan. The next morning the
cow in question was found to be fearfully mangled,
but the strange part of the story is this, that although
witnesses were set to watch the man in his cell, they
swore unanimously that he had never left it and had
passed the whole of the night in deep sleep, only at one
time making slight movements of his head, his hands
and his feet.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Just as the man who thinks he changes into a wolf
suffers from lycanthropy, so the one who believes he
changes into a dog is suffering from kynanthropy, and
those who change into kine from boanthropy. Every
part of the world chooses a special animal as being the
most suitable for disguise, and naturally enough the
animal is one which is common to the district. Thus
we find the tiger chosen for India and Asia, the bear
for Northern Europe, the lion, leopard, and hyæna for
Africa, the jaguar for South America, and so forth.</p>

<p>Many superstitions surround the tiger. Besides being
the abode of the soul of a dead man it may be the temporary
or even the permanent form of a living human
being. In India it is said that a certain root brings
about the metamorphosis and that another root is used
for the antidote. In Central Java powers of transformation
are believed to be hereditary, no shame is attached
to it, and the wer-tiger is looked upon as a friendly
animal, and if his friends call upon him by name he
behaves like a domestic pet and is believed to guard the
fields. In the Malay Peninsula faith in the genuine wer-tiger
persists, and it is thought there also that the soul
of a dead wizard enters the animal's body. During the
process of transformation the corpse is laid in the forest,
and beside it a supply of rice and water is placed, sufficient
for seven days, in which time transmigration,
resulting from a compact made by the <i>pawang's</i> ancestors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
is complete. A ceremony is also gone through by the
son of a <i>pawang</i> who wishes to succeed his father in
tiger's form.</p>

<p>A wer-tiger belief exists in India, and the Garrows
think the mania is produced by a special drug which is
laid on the forehead. First the wer-tiger pulls the earrings
out of his ears and then wanders forth alone,
shunning the company of his fellow-man. The disease
lasts about fourteen days, and patients are said to have
glaring red eyes, their hair dishevelled and bristled, and
a peculiar convulsive manner of moving the head. When
taken by fits of this kind they are believed to go forth
in the night to ride on the backs of tigers.</p>

<p>Another form of the belief is the wizard in the shape
of a tiger, and the Thana tradition is that mediums are
possessed by a tiger spirit. The Binuas of Johore think
that every <i>pawang</i> has an immortal tiger spirit.</p>

<p>The belief that lion form is assumed by wizards is
found near the Luapula and on the Zambezi, where a
certain drink is supposed to effect the transformation.
Among the Tumbukas people smear themselves with
white clay, which gives them a certain power of metempsychosis.
Not only can men take lions' shape but
lions can change into men.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<br />
LION- AND TIGER-MEN</h3>

<p>The rooted idea in the savage mind that animals may be
invested by human souls, and that men may at will
transform themselves into animals, has been largely
strengthened throughout the ages by the teachings of
the "Medicine men" or wizards, who have no doubt
found it profitable and conducive to their own acquisition
of power to work on the superstitions and foster
the weaknesses of the people to whom they minister.</p>

<p>Stories about lion- and tiger-men, hyæna-women, and
other strange monsters gifted with human qualities are
found in the Books of Travel in every part of the world.</p>

<p>The way the sorcerer sets to work on the imagination
of primitive people has often been described. Firstly
he declares that he is about to change himself into a
tiger and tear the people to pieces, and he no sooner
begins to roar than the frightened natives, acting under
the spell of suggestion, take to their heels, but they
dare not go beyond the reach of those terrible sounds.
"Look," cry the fear-stricken women, who cannot really
see what is going on, "his body is covered with spots
like a tiger! Horrible! his nails are turning into claws."</p>

<p>All the time the sorcerer is hidden in his tent, carrying
on a kind of magical performance which inspires the
people with a dread of the unknown, so that they fall
a prey to the imagination and almost lose their reason.
When asked to explain this unholy dread, they declare
that it arises from being unable to see and to kill the
fearsome tiger-image which threatens them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Africa is vastly rich in stories of wer-lions, wer-leopards,
and wer-hyænas, and the language of Bornu
has a word "<i>bultungin</i>," which means "I change myself
into a hyæna." It is even said that in the village of
Kabutiloa every native possesses the faculty of transformation.</p>

<p>The wizards of Abyssinia are said to be able to become
hyænas at will, and in "The Life of Nathaniel Pearce"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
the story is told of a man called Coffin who was asked by
a servant for leave of absence. No sooner had he granted
the request than one of the other servants called out,
"Look, look, he has turned himself into a hyæna!"
Coffin gazed in the direction in which the first servant
had disappeared, and there he saw a large hyæna bounding
across the open plain. The next morning the servant
returned, and when asked about the matter asserted that
such a transformation had actually taken place. Coffin
brought himself to believe in these native stories, and
quoted in evidence of their truth that he had often seen
a certain kind of earring in the ears of hyænas shot,
trapped and speared by himself or his friends, identical
with those which were commonly worn by the native
servants. A natural explanation has been sought in the
suggestion that the sorcerers themselves adorned the
hyænas with the gems in order to encourage a superstition
which they found profitable for their own purposes,
but no proof of any such thing has been discovered.
Abyssinia is a hotbed of strange happenings of
this character, some of which are quite beyond understanding.</p>

<p>The trade of blacksmith is hereditary there and is
regarded with more or less suspicion, from the fact that
blacksmiths are, with few exceptions, believed to be
sorcerers and are opprobriously given the name of <i>Bouda</i>.
They are said to have the power of turning themselves
into various kinds of animals. "I remember," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Mansfield Parkyns in "Life in Abyssinia,"<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> "a story of
some little girls, who, having been out in the forest to
gather sticks, came running back breathless with fright;
and on being asked what was the cause, they answered
that a blacksmith of the neighbourhood had met them,
and entering into conversation with him, they at length
began to joke about whether, as had been asserted, he
could turn himself into a hyæna. The man, they declared,
made no reply, but taking some ashes, which he
had with him tied up in the corner of his cloth, sprinkled
them over his shoulders, and to their horror and alarm
they began almost immediately to perceive that the
metamorphosis was actually taking place, and that the
blacksmith's skin was assuming the hair and colour of
the animal in question. When the change was complete
he grinned and laughed at them, and then retired into
the neighbouring thickets. They stood rooted to the
spot from sheer fright; but the moment the hideous
creature withdrew, they made the best of their way
home."</p>

<p>Parkyns tells another <i>Bouda</i> story<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> which is fully
credited by the natives. In the neighbourhood of
Adoua there was said to be a woman who had one
human foot and in the place of the other the hoof of a
donkey. Several persons assured Parkyns that they had
seen this human monstrosity, and others firmly believed
the following account of the affair:</p>

<p>The woman was said to have died, and was buried with
ceremony in the churchyard. The following day a man
came to one of the priests and offered him a sum of
money for the body, pledging himself to strict secrecy.
The bargain was concluded and the unscrupulous priest
allowed the stranger, who was a blacksmith, to disinter
and carry off the corpse. On the way to the market the
blacksmith passed the house where the deceased lady's
family lived, and he usually rode or drove a remarkably
fine donkey which, strangely enough, on passing the
house, or any of the old woman's children, brayed loudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and endeavoured to run towards them.</p>

<p>At first no notice was taken of this odd behaviour on
the part of an ass, but at last one of the sons grew suspicious
and exclaimed, "I am sure that ass is my mother!"</p>

<p>Accordingly <i>Bouda</i>, ass and all were seized and brought
to the hut, much to the apparent satisfaction of the
animal, which rubbed its nose against the young men
and was even said to shed tears of joy on the occasion.</p>

<p>On being charged with the offence of sorcery the
<i>Bouda</i> tried to make light of it and denied the accusation,
but at last by dint of threats and promises he was
induced to confess that he had turned the old woman
into a donkey, she having been not really dead but in a
trance, into which he had purposely thrown her. His
power, he asserted, was sufficient to change the external
appearance, but not to alter the mind of his victim.
Hence it was that the old woman, or rather donkey,
possessed human feelings, which she had displayed in
her endeavours to enter her former habitation and in
her recognition of her children. The <i>Bouda</i>, moreover,
agreed to restore her human appearance, and began his
exorcism. As he proceeded she by degrees assumed her
natural form, and the change was almost complete, when
one of the sons, blinded by his rage, forgot the promises
of pardon which the <i>Bouda</i> had exacted, and drove his
spear through his heart. The incantation not being
entirely finished, one foot remained in the shape of the
hoof of an ass and continued so until her death, which
was not till many years afterwards.</p>

<p>Still another story belonging to the same class concerns
two brothers who lived in Gojam. One of them having
transformed himself into a horse, ass or cow, was sold
in the market and driven out of town by his purchaser.
Directly night had closed the eyes of his new master in
sleep the <i>Bouda</i> took on human form again and walked
quietly home. The brothers were known to sell cattle
in the market so frequently that people became suspicious,
because they did not know where their stock was kept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and they often had no beasts in their yard even the very
day before the sales. Besides, it soon leaked out that
every animal sold make its escape the same night and was
never heard of again. Then a purchaser who had been
twice taken in by the brothers, determined to discover
how the fraud was carried out. One market day he
bought a fine horse from one of the brothers and rode
off upon it, but no sooner had he left the market town
behind him than he dismounted and drove a knife
through the animal's heart. Then he walked back to
the market-place and meeting the vendor told him that
he had killed the beautiful animal he had just bought in
a fit of passion. The <i>Bouda</i> gave a start, but managed to
conceal his grief till he entered his house, when he burst
forth into lamentations and rubbed the skin off his forehead,
as the custom is when a near relative dies. To his
inquisitive neighbours he declared that his favourite
brother had been robbed and murdered in the Galla
country, whither he had travelled in order to purchase
horses. It was said, however, that he afterwards sent no
more animals to the market-place for sale.</p>

<p>According to Livingstone's account<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the Makololo
also believe that certain people can transform themselves
into animals, and they call such persons "Pondoro."
Livingstone came across a Pondoro in the
Kebrasa hills, and heard that this gentleman was in the
habit of assuming the shape of a lion which he retained
for days and sometimes even for a month, during which
time he wandered in the woods where his wife had built
a den for him and took care that he was provided with
food and drink. No one was allowed into the den except
the Pondoro and his wife, and no strangers were permitted
even to lay a gun against any of the trees in the
neighbourhood of the den, or against any shanty owned
by the Pondoro. The wer-lion used his gift to go
hunting in the village. After a few days had passed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
faithful spouse scented her returning husband and provided
him with a certain kind of medicine or ointment
by which it became possible for him to change into a
man again. But she had to hurry over this duty, so that
the lion might not catch sight of her and, falling upon
her, devour even her.</p>

<p>After the Pondoro was once more human he returned
to the village and asked the inhabitants to help him
carry home his prey. One of the odd things about this
wer-lion was that he always trembled if he smelt gunpowder,
and he sometimes overacted his part. Livingstone
asked the natives to make him show off while he
was watching, offering a reward for the performance,
but they refused, saying, "If we ask him to do so, he
may change while we are asleep and kill us." It was
owing to his distaste for the smell of gunpowder that it
was made punishable to rest muskets against his den.</p>

<p>In the same district the belief is also current that the
souls of departed chiefs enter into lions "and render
them sacred." Thus when a hungry lion prowled round
the camp where a freshly killed buffalo lay, a native
servant harangued him loudly in between his roars,
saying, "What sort of a chief do you call yourself,
sneaking round here in the dark trying to steal our
buffalo meat? You're a pretty chief, you are! You've
no more courage than a scavenger beetle. Why don't
you kill your own dinner?" The Pondoro took no
notice except to roar the louder, so a second native took
the matter up and expostulated in more dignified terms
as to the impropriety of the conduct of "a great chief
like him" prowling round in the dark, "trying like a
hyæna to steal the food of strangers."</p>

<p>A piece of meat dipped in strychnine brought the
lion-chief to his senses and he took his departure. It is
not to be wondered at that such things occur in a country
where the natives regard their chiefs as almighty and
infallible. The extent of their faith in him appears from
the story of one Chief Chibisa, who placed a powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
"medicine" in the river and told his people they might
safely enter the water as it was a protection against the
bite of crocodiles. Thereupon the people bathed there
without fear of these dangerous reptiles.</p>

<p>Du Chaillu, in "Ashango Land,"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> tells the story of a
young lad, Akosho, who declared that he had been
turned into a leopard, and feeling a craving for blood
had gone forth into the forest where he had killed two
men. After each murder he said he had taken on human
shape. His chief Akondogo could not believe the story,
but Akosho led him to the scene where lay the mangled
bodies of the victims. It appears that the boy suffered
from lycanthropia, and he was burnt to death in full
view of the tribe.</p>

<p>Theophilus Waldmeier mentions a similar case of
possession in which the patient thought herself to be a
hyæna.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> One evening when he was in his house at
Gaffat a woman began to cry fearfully and run up and
down the road on her hands and feet like a wild beast,
quite unconscious of what she was doing. The natives
said to him, "This is the <i>Bouda</i>, and if it is not driven
out of her she will die." A crowd gathered round and
everything possible was done to relieve her condition,
but without avail. She howled and roared in an unnatural
manner and most powerful voice. At last a
blacksmith, who was said to have secret connection with
the evil one, was called in to see what he could do. The
woman obeyed his orders at once. He took hold of her
hand and dropped the juice of a white onion or garlic
into her nostril, and then he questioned the evil spirit,
by whom she was supposed to be possessed, as follows:</p>

<p>"Why did you possess this poor woman?"</p>

<p>"I was allowed to do so," came the answer through
her lips.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Gebroo."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"And your country?"</p>

<p>"Godjam."</p>

<p>"How many people have you already taken possession
of?"</p>

<p>"Forty people&mdash;men and women."</p>

<p>"You must now leave this woman's body."</p>

<p>"I will do so on one condition."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I want to eat the flesh of a donkey."</p>

<p>The long cross-examination being concluded the evil
spirit was granted his strange request. A donkey was
brought and the possessed woman ran hastily upon the
animal and bit the flesh out of the creature's back, and
though the donkey kicked and started off, she clung to it
as though fastened by leather thongs.</p>

<p>After the performance had continued for some time
the man recalled the woman, and a jar of prepared liquid
with which much filth had been mixed was set down in
a hidden spot where she could not see it. When, however,
the exorcist exclaimed, "Go and look for your drink,"
she started off on all fours to the place where the jar
stood and drank the whole of its contents.</p>

<p>When she returned, the blacksmith said, "Take up
this stone." Although the stone in question was too
large for her to move under natural conditions, she
placed it on her head with ease and began spinning
round, until the stone flew off on one side and she fell on
to the ground. Then the exorcist said to the people
round, "Take her away to bed, the <i>Bouda</i> has left her."</p>

<p>In a similar case the woman's symptoms began in a
sort of fainting-fit; her fingers were clenched in the
palms of her hands, the eyes were glazed, the nostrils
distended and the whole body stiff and inflexible. Suddenly
a hideous laugh, like that of a hyæna, burst from
her and she began running about on all fours. The cure
was brought about in much the same way as in the
preceding case.</p>

<p>Mr. Parkyns also tells the tale of a servant who was
said to have been bewitched by a blacksmith-hyæna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
He evidently attempted to lure her into the forest with
the intention of devouring her.</p>

<p>One evening the howls and laughter of a hyæna were
clearly heard from the hut in which the sick woman lay
bound and closely guarded. Her master happened to
be present, when he saw to his astonishment that she
rose "like a Davenport brother" freed from her bonds,
and made an effort to escape from the hut in answer to
the call of the wild animal without.</p>

<p>That such proceedings were sometimes carried out
for vicious ends not unconnected with the slaying of
human victims is proved by the existence of the mysterious
Human Leopard Society which Mr. T. J. Alldridge
writes about in "The Sherbro and Its Hinterland."
The society was founded for the purpose of obtaining
the human fat used in the preparation of a certain
"medicine" mixed with Borfinor, the resulting material
being regarded as an all-powerful fetish.</p>

<p>Victims at first were relatives of the members of the
society selected at committee meetings, who were afterwards
waylaid and slaughtered by a man in the guise of a
leopard. He plunged a three-pronged knife into the
unfortunate person's neck from behind, separated the
vertebræ and caused instant death. More victims were
required, outsiders were made to join the society by
the expedient of giving them a dish in which, without
their knowledge, human flesh was cooked. Afterwards,
on being informed of the unpleasant fact, they were
persuaded to join the society and told they must furnish
a victim as part of the initiation ceremony.</p>

<p>The members of the society rapidly increased in
number but great secrecy was observed, and it was
impossible to bring the criminals to justice. When
questioned the victims declared that they had seen
nothing. The leopard sprang from the bush, and it
merely seemed as though a great wind had rushed by.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Before seizing their victims the human leopards cover
themselves with the skin of the animal and imitate its
roars. In the paws of the leopard skin are fixed sharp-pointed
knives shaped like a leopard's claws, which are
intended to inflict similar wounds, the better to avoid
unpleasant disclosure.</p>

<p>Many of the Indians in Guiana believe that "Kanaima"
tigers are possessed by human spirits who, as men, devote
themselves to deeds of cannibalism. Taking the
shape of the jaguar they approach the lonely sleeping-places,
or waylay Indians in the forests. No superstition
causes more terror.</p>

<p>A legend exists among the natives about an old man
who lurked in the forest in the shape of a Kanaima tiger.
His son, who was hunting, shot the tiger down. His
arrow, which was one of the old-fashioned sort, tipped
with bone, entered the animal's jaw. The tiger raised
its paw, broke off the weapon and vanished into the
forest. The young huntsman picked up the splintered
arrow-head and returned home. Next day his guilty
father came back groaning, and cried out that his mouth
was "all on fire." The son drew from his cheek a bone
which, oddly enough, fitted into his splintered arrow-head.
Then the son was very sorrowful and said to his
father that he must leave him and take his young wife
away too, for neither of them would be safe from the
dread Kanaima charm. This is a specimen of the
"repercussion" stories, in which the wound inflicted
on the wer-animal appears in the human form.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
<br />
WER-FOX AND WER-VIXEN</h3>


<p>Even more elaborate in detail and richness of lore than
the lion-, tiger- and hyæna-transformations, are those of
the wer-fox; and a curious point to be noted is that it
is quite as easy for the animal to become human as for a
man or woman to become a fox. In Japanese folklore
the fox is regarded as more skilful than any other animal
in taking human shape.</p>

<p>In China the belief exists that foxes and wolves attain
to an age of eight hundred years, and "when more
than five hundred years old they are able to metamorphose
themselves into beings shaped liked men."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>De Groot tells several stories about wer-foxes.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> A
man runs away from home and is found in an empty
grave. His shape is quite that of a fox, and does not in
any respect correspond to the human form. The only
sound he utters is O-tsze (meaning red) which is the name
for foxes. For ten days this wer-fox remains in a state
of semi-consciousness, and then he awakens and gives the
following account of himself: "When the fox came to
me for the first time it assumed the shape of a lovely
woman standing in a fowl-house in a hidden corner of
my dwelling. She called me to her and told me she bore
the name of O-tsze.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> When she had called me many
times I followed her and she became my wife. At night
I frequently accompanied her to her dwelling, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
met without being perceived by the dogs."</p>

<p>No human animal is as seductive as the wer-vixen.
Numerous stories occur in Eastern folklore of women
in the shape of foxes and foxes in the shape of women
leading men on through passion to their doom. Even
male foxes take the shape of women to seduce men, but
other harm than this they do not do them.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Ono, an inhabitant of Mino (says an ancient Japanese
legend of <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 545), spent the seasons longing for his
ideal of female beauty. He met her one evening on a
vast moor and married her. Simultaneously with the
birth of their son, Ono's dog was delivered of a pup
which as it grew up became more and more hostile to
the lady of the moors. She begged her husband to kill
it, but he refused. At last one day the dog attacked
her so furiously that she lost courage, resumed vulpine
shape, leaped over a fence and fled.</p>

<p>"You may be a fox," Ono called after her, "but you
are the mother of my son and I love you. Come back
when you please; you will always be welcome."</p>

<p>So every evening she stole back and slept in his arms.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The wer-fox has a strange manner of bringing about
transformation. Roaming over a grassy plain, the animal
picks up a skull, puts it on his head and, facing towards
the north star, worships silently. At first he performs
his religious genuflections and obeisances slowly and
circumspectly, but by and by his motions become convulsively
rapid and his leaps wondrously active. Yet,
however high he jumps towards the star, he endeavours to
keep his skull-crown immovable, and if after a hundred
acts of worship he succeeds, he becomes capable of transforming
himself into a human being. But if he desires
to assume the shape of a beautiful maiden he must live
in the vicinity of a graveyard.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>A monk who passed a moonlight night in a graveyard
saw a fox placing withered bones and a skull upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
head, and as soon as the animal succeeded in moving its
head without dropping its burden, it covered its body
with grass and leaves, and changed into a beautiful
woman. She sat by the roadside, and presently a man
came riding by to whom she told a pitiable story about
herself. Charmed with her appearance and sympathising
with her forlorn condition, he was about to ask her to
mount his horse with him, when the monk appeared from
behind a gravestone and warned him that the woman
was not what she appeared to be. Making the sign of the
cross and uttering an incantation, the holy man caused
the woman to fall down, and she turned into an old
vixen and expired. Nothing remained but the dry bones
with the skull, and the grass and the leaves on the dead
body of the fox.</p>

<p>De Groot quotes the old Chinese saying that the wild
fox bears the name of Tsze (Red). At night he strikes
fire out of his tail. When he desires to appear as a spook
he puts on a human skull and salutes the Great Bear constellation,
and the transformation is brought about as
soon as the skull ceases to fall.</p>

<p>One of the commonest stories of the fox, found in
China and Japan, is that the fox as usual assumes the form
of a lovely maiden, and weds a man. She dies and all
that remains is the dead body of the fox. No more is
heard of the woman.</p>

<p>The Eskimos have a similar story.</p>

<p>A bachelor coming home in the evening finds his hut
tidied. One day, returning prematurely, he sees a woman
at work straightening his things. He falls in love with
her and marries her, only to discover that she is a fox in
disguise, and when his jealous cousin mentions the
tabooed subject of the smell of a fox, she runs away,
never to return.</p>

<p>Under the T'ang dynasty the belief in wer-vixens, who
changed into fascinating women to tempt men, was
prevalent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"When a fox is fifty years old, it can transform itself
into a woman; when a hundred years old, it becomes a
beautiful female or sorceress termed <i>wu</i>. Such enchanted
beings possess a knowledge of what is happening more
than a thousand miles away. They can poison men by
sorcery or possess and bewilder them so that they lose
their memory or even their reason. When a fox reaches
the age of a thousand it goes to paradise and becomes a
celestial creature."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The wer-vixen in the next story had not attained to
this privilege, she belonged to a far different region.</p>

<p>A captain in the Imperial Guard met a beautiful lady
in the moonlight and began to talk to her. While she
was speaking to him she kept her face hidden behind a
fan. As they came to the palace the man remembered
that wer-vixens were dangerous beings to deal with and
he wanted to find out whether the woman was genuine
or an animal in human shape, so he drew his sword,
seized her by the hair, pushed her against one of the
pillars in front of the palace and threatened to kill her.
She struggled and jumped about violently, sending forth
so pungent an odour that he could not hold her, and as
he let her go she turned into a fox and ran off shrieking
"ko, ko!" The captain did not in the least regret
the rough handling he had given the supposed beautiful
lady; he only wished he had killed her on the
spot.</p>

<p>Fox demons are said to cause disease and madness, and
sometimes they act in a spirit of revenge, more often
from unprovoked malice. The "Huen Chung ki" mentions
that foxes sometimes take the shape of Buddhas
or Bodhisattvas. Another mystic idea about wer-foxes
is that they are believed to possess a mysterious pearl
which represents their soul. They hold this pearl in
their mouths and any man who gets possession of it
becomes a favourite throughout the world. In Japan
some people think that foxes have a luminous pearl in
their tail. Whether this is connected with the soul or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
whether it is a talisman of power it is difficult to say.</p>

<p>Wer-foxes in the shape of human beings can be made
to resume their animal forms by wounding or slaying
them or by setting dogs upon them. Incantations,
argument if they appear in the shape of scholars, poisonous
food, written charms, or cutting off the caudal
appendage if they show signs of one, are also effective
means of making them declare themselves in their true
colours.</p>

<p>If a person is possessed by a wer-fox he can have the
evil spirit transferred to a woman in a similar manner to
that practised by the <i>Boudas</i> of Abyssinia in the case of
those possessed by hyænas. In one instance the evil
spirit spoke from the scape-woman's mouth as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am a fox. I have not come to do evil, but only to
have a look round, because I thought there was plenty of
food at a place like this. Then I found that I (the patient)
was kept indoors." Thus speaking, she took from her
bosom a white gem, the size of a small orange. Throwing
this into the air, she caught it again, and those who saw
it said, "What a strange gem; she keeps it in her pocket
for the purpose of deluding people." A young man
cleverly caught the gem as the woman threw it up and
put it in his pocket. The demon fox begged him to
give it back to her but he refused. She then burst into
tears and said, "My gem is of no value to you for you
do not know how to use it. If you do not give it back to
me I will be your enemy for ever, but if you do, I will
be your friend and protect you like a god." At these
words the young man returned the gem.</p>

<p>When the sorcerer had exorcised the fox spirit it was
discovered that the gem had disappeared, which was
taken as a proof that it belonged to the wer-fox, and was
connected with some mysterious power.</p>

<p>The fox kept its promise, for when the young man
was going home late one night in the dark, he became
suddenly very frightened and called the fox to help
him. The animal appeared and led him by a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
footpath instead of by the usual road. Afterwards he
discovered that highwaymen were hidden in ambush
near the road, and if he had passed that way he would
surely have been killed.</p>

<p>The cunning of the fox turns to learning in a man,
for intellectuality appears to be regarded as a fox-like
trait by the Japanese, and many tales tell of scholars
becoming animals and vice-versa.</p>

<p>A learned old man called Hu suddenly disappeared
from the college in which he held a professorship, and
was found by his students in the shape of a fox explaining
logic out of an old book to a pack of foxes who were
drawn up in ranks before him in an empty grave.</p>

<p>Two foxes, in another story, were over a thousand
years old and lived in the tomb of a king. They transformed
themselves into students, giving proof of extraordinary
learning, and having fine personalities and handsome,
open countenances. Mounted on horseback they
rode to the house of a talented minister to argue with
him on theological questions connected with the spirit
of the glorification tree which stood before a tomb.
The minister could not get the better of them in discussion,
and after three days he became suspicious and
set his dogs loose upon them, but they showed not the
slightest fear. "To be sure," he exclaimed, "they are
spectres of the true sort. If a hundred years old, they
must change their shape at the sight of hounds; if they
are spooks of a thousand years, they must change when
they see the glow of fire produced from a tree of the
same age." Reasoning thus, the minister sent some
servants to the tomb in order to fell the glorification
tree. The spirit of the tree was a young child dressed
in blue garments, and he was sitting in a cleft in the
side of the tree. When the child was told of the matter
he wept, and lamented the ignorance of the old foxes
and his own fate. Then he vanished. When the servants
felled the tree, blood gushed forth from it. They took
the wood home and set fire to it, and as soon as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
kindled the foxes resumed their original shape. Then
the minister had them captured and cooked.</p>

<p>The power possessed by the fox of bewitching men is
clearly shown in the following story quoted by Dr.
Visser in "The Fox and Badger in Japanese Folklore."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In the eighth year of the Kwambei era (896) a man
called Kaya Yoshifuji resigned the post of a high official
in the Bizen province and went to live in Hongo Ashimori.
His wife ran away to the capital and he kept house
quite alone. One day he went out of his mind and began
to recite love poems to an imaginary woman. After a
month passed in this manner he disappeared and his
relatives searched high and low but could find no trace
of him, so they concluded that he had committed suicide,
and vowed they would make an image of the eleven-faced
Kwannon if they found the unhappy man's corpse.
They cut down an oak tree and began to carve the life-size
image of Yoshifuji, bowing before the unfinished
statue to repeat the vow they had taken. This went on
for about a fortnight, when to their intense surprise
Yoshifuji crept from under his go-down as thin and pale
as though he had passed through a serious illness. The
floor of the go-down was only half a dozen inches from
the ground, so that it was held to be impossible that a
man could have been beneath it. When he had recovered
his senses sufficiently to give an account of his adventures,
he said that a beautiful girl had come to him, bringing
love letters and poems from a princess, and that he
had replied to them in the same vein in which they were
written.</p>

<p>"At last," he continued, "the girl came with a magnificent
carriage and four postilions to take me to the
princess.</p>

<p>"After a drive of about ten miles we arrived at a
splendid palace, where an exquisite meal and a very hearty
reception from the princess soon made me feel quite at
ease. There I lived with her as inseparably as two branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
growing together on the same tree. She gave birth to a
son, a very intelligent and beautiful child, whom I loved
so much that I thought of degrading my son Jadasada
and putting this child in his place as son of my principal
wife&mdash;this in view of the high rank of the princess. But
after three years a Buddhist priest suddenly entered the
room of Her Highness, carrying a stick in his hand. The
effect of his appearance was astonishing. Chamberlains
and Court ladies all fled left and right and even the princess
hid herself somewhere. The priest pushed me from
behind with his stick and made me go out of the house
through a very narrow passage. When I looked back I
discovered that I had just crept from under my own
go-down!"</p>

<p>The curious point of this story is that those who
listened to it rushed to the go-down and demolished it
without delay. As they did so, twenty or thirty foxes
came from beneath it and scattered in all directions,
hastening to the mountains. Yoshifuji, bewitched by
these wizard-foxes, had been lying under the go-down
for a fortnight, believing in his trance that he was spending
three years in a palace. The priest who broke the
spell was a metamorphosis of Kwannon.</p>

<p>That the wer-vixen superstition is deeply engrained
in the minds of travellers is proved by the story of a
bishop who once passed the night in a house which was
so desolate in appearance that his companions begged
him to read a sutra for the purpose of driving away evil
influences. Two of them went to a wood close to the
house, where they saw a mysterious phantom, large and
white, which they took to be a wer-vixen. They rushed
in to tell the bishop, who, greatly excited, cried, "I have
often heard of foxes haunting people, but I have never
set eyes on a ghost of this kind," and he hastened to the
spot, full of eagerness, only to discover a harmless,
ordinary girl&mdash;or so he said!</p>

<p>Another wer-vixen attempted to steal a child. The
nurse was out in the grounds with her charge of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
years old when her master, the father of the infant,
heard her crying for help. Seizing his sword he ran to
the spot, when to his astonishment he found that <i>two</i>
nurses exactly alike were pulling at his son and heir,
one on one side and one on the other. He could not
say which was the genuine nurse, and in great terror
brandished his sword, making feints at both. Thereupon
one of the nurses vanished and the other swooned,
the child still in her arms. A priest was sent for and by
means of incantations brought the nurse to her senses.
She then said that her double had appeared and laying
hold of the babe had claimed it as her own. Nobody
knew whether the phantom was a <i>fox</i> or a <i>spirit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Here is a story of a vindictive wer-fox, taken from the
"Uji shui monogatari":&mdash;</p>

<p>"A samurai was on his way home one evening when he
met a fox. Pursuing the animal, he sent an arrow into
its loin. The fox howled loudly and limped quickly
away through the grass towards the samurai's house.
When the man saw the animal was breathing fire he
hastened to overtake him, but was too late. The fox,
on arriving at the house, assumed human shape and set
fire to the building. Then the samurai pursued the
culprit, whom he took to be a real man, but, resuming
vulpine form, the animal disappeared into the thicket."</p>

<p>A number of fox legends, which have been rendered
into English by Dr. Visser, are found in the "Kokon
chomonshu."</p>

<p>The house of a Dainagon was haunted by a number of
foxes, and was so impossible to live in that the owner
decided to hold a battue. The very night he gave orders
to this effect he saw a vision of a grey-haired old man,
with the figure of a tall boy, wearing a green hunting
dress, and seated under an orange tree in the garden.
The owner asked the apparition's name, and he replied,
"I have lived in your house for two generations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
have a great number of children and grandchildren. I
have always tried to keep them out of mischief but they
never would listen. Now I am sorry because they have
made you angry. If you will forgive the things my
family have done, I will protect you and let you know
whenever good luck is coming your way."</p>

<p>Then the owner of the house awoke from his strange
dream, rose and opened the door of the verandah. There
he discovered in the dim morning light an old hairless
fox, shyly trying to hide himself behind a bamboo bench.</p>

<p>The <i>tanuki</i>, or badger, shares with the fox the reputation
for powers of transformation. This animal appeared
in Japanese folklore later than the fox, but is often coupled
with it in stories of animal sorcery. An old mountain
lake was frequented by many water birds, but it was
well known that whoever tried to shoot them was
drowned in the lake. At last a man, who had more
courage than the others, decided that this mysterious
matter must be looked into. He went alone in the dark,
armed with bow, arrows, and a sword, and when he
reached the lake he sat down under a pine tree, bent his
bow and waited. Suddenly the surface of the lake was
disturbed, waves dashed on the shore and he saw a faint
light in the centre. The ball of light moved about,
coming closer and closer, and circling round him. He
was about to shoot at it when it flew back over the lake.
Presently it came close to him again, and in the centre he
saw a grinning old hag, upon whom he seized. She tried
to pull him into the lake, but could not manage to do so,
for he stood like a rock and, having thrown down his
bow, stabbed at her with his sword. She grew weaker
and weaker and the light disappeared. Then she died,
and he took home the animal shape which was left on his
hands, and which proved to be an old <i>tanuki</i>.</p>

<p>Another story of the <i>tanuki</i> is more like a ghost story
than that of a wer-animal, and concerns a captain of the
guards called Sukeyasu. When he was hunting in the
province of Tamba he passed the night in an old chapel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
which the villagers warned him was haunted by a monster.
As a snowstorm was raging he preferred to face the strange
risk inside the chapel to a certain wetting in the open.</p>

<p>He was half asleep when he heard a noise outside the
chapel and peeping through a chink in the sliding door
he saw a pitch-black priest, so tall that his head appeared
to reach the eaves. The priest stretched a thin hairy
arm through the chink in the door and stroked Sukeyasu's
forehead, afterwards withdrawing his hand. The captain
was too frightened to move, but when the same thing
was repeated he plucked up courage to grasp the hairy
hand and hold it firmly. Then ensued a struggle and the
door gave way. Sukeyasu came down on the top of the
priest and as he pressed upon him with all his might he
found his opponent growing smaller and smaller, and
his arms thinner and thinner. The captain called his
servants to his assistance and when a light was obtained
it was found that the huge spook was in reality a <i>tanuki</i>.
Next day the animal's head was shown to the villagers,
and from that time the chapel was no longer haunted.</p>

<p>An unsuccessful transformation into animal shape is
the subject of another wer-fox story. A man left his
house one evening in order to do some business in a
neighbouring city, but to his wife's surprise he came
back accompanied by a servant long before he was due,
saying that he had accomplished his business satisfactorily.
He was very tired and went to bed at once, but an old
woman-servant in the house warned her mistress, saying
that she had noticed something odd about the returned
traveller, who was blind in the left eye, while her master
was blind in the right eye. The wife then called to the
sleeping man, saying she was ill, and asking him to get
her some medicine. He did so, grumbling, and to the
wife's astonishment, she saw that what the old woman
said was true. Then when he lay down to sleep again she
stabbed him to death, and he cried out like a fox, "kon,
kon, kwai&mdash;kwai." Then they beat to death the servant
the wer-fox had brought with him, and found he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
also a fox. The one who had taken the shape of the
master had not trained himself carefully enough in the
art of transformation.</p>

<p>A very uncanny fox and badger story comes from an
old Japanese source.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Kugano Kendo was a clever
doctor who lived in Yeddo. One day he was asked to
go and see a patient in the country, and when he reached
the house in question, which he had never before visited,
he found that the master had gone out and he was asked
to wait. A page-boy offered him some refreshments
after his long journey, and when he was about to thank
him for his attentions the boy turned away and, to the
doctor's astonishment, he saw the page's face had
utterly changed, becoming enormously long and narrow,
with a small nose and big mouth and only one eye in the
centre of the forehead. Suddenly the apparition vanished.
Though courageous by nature this struck the
doctor as so extraordinary that he felt inclined to leave
the strange house at once. However, he mastered his
fears and soon the owner of the house returned. The
doctor told him what he had seen and the master burst
out laughing and said, "Oh, that boy has been at it
again, has he? He always frightens strangers. Did he
pull a face like this?" and suiting his actions to his
words the man imitated the horrible expression, his
face taking the same deformity of one eye in the centre
of his forehead, and a foxy snout.</p>

<p>This was too much for the doctor's equanimity. He
ran to the front door and called his servants to prepare
for the journey home. Then he found that all the
servants had run away except one, and outside it was
pitch-dark. The remaining servant said he could find
a lantern, and presently he appeared out of the darkness
with a light in his hand which fell full upon his
features. To Kendo's intense horror he noticed the
same transformation had taken place in the servant's
countenance as had appeared in the faces of the others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and this additional strain being too much for his nerves,
he cried out and fell into a swoon.</p>

<p>In the meantime the doctor's friends, growing anxious
about his long absence, despatched a search party to
find him, and among those who were sent were some of
the servants who had accompanied him earlier in the
evening. To their surprise, instead of the fine house
they had already visited, they found only an old, dirty,
tumbledown cottage, which the neighbours told them
was always desolate and only inhabited by foxes and
<i>tanuki</i>. Nobody dared to pass that way by night. After
a long search Doctor Kendo was found lying face downwards
in a bamboo grove. Weeks passed before he
recovered from his adventure. This story seems to throw
a light on what may be called "the workings of transformation,"
as though a partial change were brought
about by some hidden occult force glimmering through
the human shape.</p>

<p>The "Roo chawa"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> describes three kinds of strange
wer-animals. Firstly thin ones, with emaciated features,
red eyes, long trunks, legs the length of a horse, and a
loud cry "like the tone of a bell." These are <i>tanuki</i>.
The second variety has a round face, sharp nose, spotted
skin and is blind in one eye. Thirdly, there are foxes
with large ears, round eyes, pointed cheeks, wide mouths,
but <i>without a right arm</i>! This sounds as though the
description had been taken during the process of metamorphosis.</p>

<p>The one-eyed beasts seem the most fearsome to encounter
in the dark. An ancient monastery was haunted
by them. An old man, blind in one eye, arrived there
as the priest was murmuring his prayers. He came near
enough to stroke the devout man's face, but as he put
out his hand to do so the priest protected himself with
a knife and chopped off the arm, which proved to be the
hairy leg of an old fox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>Another man who passed the night in the same monastery
was disturbed by a number of puppy-dogs which
ran in and out of the cloisters. Looking through a crack
in an old door he saw a woman standing outside. He
pierced her through the breast with his sword and she
fled, bleeding profusely. A moment later a ball of light
fell onto the ground, and when the man ran to see
what it was, he found the same old witch. Again he
struck at her with his sword and she fled, leaving another
pool of blood.</p>

<p>Next day an old one-eyed woman came to the monastery
accompanied by a little girl and asked the abbot
to read a mass at the funeral of her elder sister.</p>

<p>The abbot, believing all was not right with these
people, chased away the woman and child by threatening
to strike them with a bamboo cane. That night the
village was lit by burning torches and a crowd assembled
to pray and read sutras. Temple gongs and kettle-drums
resounded, and everyone knew that some mysterious
ceremony was being held. The following morning the
abbot sent to discover what had taken place and an old
dead <i>tanuki</i>, as big as a calf, was dug out of the ground.
It was found to be the witch that had been wounded in
the monastery. This may be compared with the witch-cat
stories of England in the following chapter.</p>

<p>Fox-possession and fox-familiars are common beliefs
among the Japanese; women, weak men, and even
children suffering from the idea of having been transformed
into animals. They are cured by being made to
snuff up smoke from a heap of burning refuse, or by
drinking weak tea, or swallowing roasted leaves of a
certain plant; all these things being detested by foxes,
and incidentally no doubt useful in cases of ordinary
hysteria. Foxes which take the form of men and women
soon resume vulpine shape when fumigated, bathed, or
attacked by dogs. Even in the present day, fox-possession
has as great a hold on the imagination as in earlier
centuries, but it is more widely ascribed to human sorcery.
Certain sacred temples in Japan still attract crowds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
pilgrims who believe that they are possessed by foxes
and who come to these holy places to be cured. The
bone of a tortoise's foot held in the left hand is prescribed
as a talisman against this fearsome spell&mdash;probably
also many other of the formulæ useful in cases of witchcraft
would be found efficacious.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />
<br />
WITCHES</h3>


<p>Amongst the powers with which witches have been
credited from time immemorial are those of transforming
themselves into various kinds of animals, of transforming
other people into animals and of sending forth
so-called familiars in various animal shapes. Whether
witches can change human beings into animals through
sorcery is a question which has exercised the minds of
hundreds of writers on demonology and witchcraft,
amongst them, to mention a few at random, Bodin,
Boguet, James I, Glanvill, Dr. Webster, Reginald Scott,
his more famous namesake Sir Walter, and Charles
Lamb. The last-named, in his essay on the subject,
tells us that he was extremely inquisitive from his childhood
about witches and witch-stories, and that it should
cause no wonder if the wicked, having been symbolised
by a goat, should come sometimes in that body and
"assert his metaphor."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In the Middle Ages witches who were condemned to
the stake, confessed to having taken the shapes of cats,
hares, dogs, horses, and many other animals, being
prompted to such changes by the devil, with whom they
were in league.</p>

<p>A witch trial took place at Lancaster on the 10th of
February, 1633, in which a batch of witches was accused
of such dealings.</p>

<p>Evidence was given by Edmund Robinson, son of
Edmund Robinson, of Pendle forest, eleven years of age,
at Padham, before Richard Shuttleworth and John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Starkey, Justices of the Peace, "who upon oath informeth,
being examined concerning the great meeting of
the witches of Pendle, saith that upon All Saints-day
last past, he, this informer being with one Henry Parker
a near door-neighbour to him in Wheatley Cave, desired
the said Parker to give him leave to gather some bulloes,
which he did. In gathering whereof he saw two greyhounds,
namely a black and a brown; one came running
over the next field towards him, he verily thinking the
one of them to be Mr. Nutter's and the other to be Mr.
Robinson's, the said gentlemen then having suchlike.
And saith the said greyhounds came to him, and fawned
on him, they having about their necks either of them a
collar, unto which was tied a string: which collars (as
this informant affirmeth) did shine like gold. And he
was thinking that some either of Mr. Nutter's or Mr.
Robinson's family should have followed them, yet seeing
nobody to follow them, he took the same greyhounds
thinking to course with them. And presently a hare did
rise very near before him. At the sight whereof he cried
'Loo, Loo, Loo,' but the dogs would not run. Whereupon
he being very angry took them and with the strings
that were about their collars, tied them to a little bush
at the next hedge, and, with a switch that he had in his
hand, he beat them. And instead of the black greyhound
Dickenson's wife stood up, a neighbour whom
this informer knoweth. And instead of the brown one
a little boy whom this informant knoweth not. At which
sight this informer being afraid, endeavoured to run
away; and being stayed by the woman, namely Dickenson's
wife, she put her hand into her pocket, and pulled
forth a piece of silver much like to a fair shilling, and
offered to give it him to hold his tongue and not tell:
which he refused saying, 'Nay, thou art a witch.' Whereupon
she put her hand into her pocket again, and pulled
out a thing like unto a bridle that jingled, which she put
on the little boy's head; which said boy stood up in
the likeness of a white horse, and in the brown greyhound's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
stead. Then immediately Dickenson's wife took
the informer before her upon the said horse and carried
him to a new house called Hearthstones, being about a
quarter of a mile off." Here the boy, Edmund Robinson,
was witness to the extraordinary incidents of a feast of
witches, all of which he recounted before the judges,
and then his father, being called, gave evidence that he
had sent his son to fetch home two kine, and as he did
not return he went to seek him, finding him eventually
"so affrighted and distracted that he neither knew his
father, nor did he know where he was, and so continued
very nearly a quarter of an hour before he came to himself,
when he told the above curious happenings."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The seventeen Pendle forest witches condemned in
Lancashire obtained a reprieve and were sent to London,
where they were examined by His Majesty himself and
the Council.</p>

<p>A witch called Julian Cox, aged about seventy years,
was indicted at Taunton, in Somerset, in 1663, for transforming
herself into a hare and for other sorcery.</p>

<p>The evidence given to prove that she was a witch
was embodied in a narrative deposed to by Mr. Pool, a
servant and officer in the court to Judge Archer, then
Judge of Assizes at Taunton.</p>

<p>"The first witness was a huntsman, who swore that he
went out with a pack of hounds to hunt a hare, and not
far from Julian Cox her house, he at last started a hare.
The dogs hunted her very close, and the third ring
hunted her in view, till at last the huntsman perceiving
the hare almost spent, and making toward a great bush
he ran on the other side of the bush to take her up, and
preserve her from the dogs. But as soon as he laid hands
on her, it proved to be Julian Cox, who had her head
grovelling on the ground and her globes (as he expressed
it) upward. He knowing her, was so affrighted that his
hair on his head stood on end, and yet spake to her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
asked her what brought her there; but she was so far
out of breath, that she could not make him any answer.
His dogs also came up with full cry to recover the
game and smelt at her, and so left off hunting any
farther. And the huntsman went home presently, sadly
affrighted."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In a report dated in the latter half of the nineteenth
century on the state of the county prison at Dingwall, a
statement was made by a fisherman who was imprisoned
for assaulting a woman of sixty, whom he accused of
bewitching everything he had. She prevented him from
catching fish and caused his boat to upset. The other
fishermen then refused to work with him as a companion.
"She is known in all the neighbourhood to be a witch,"
he deposed. "She has been seen a hundred times milking
the cows in the shape of a hare, though I never saw
her do it myself."</p>

<p>"People believe that if anyone gets blood from a
witch she can do them no more harm, and that is the
reason I cut her with a knife, so that it might go into
her as short a way as possible. All I wanted was to get
blood," was his quaint way of putting it.</p>

<p>The hare has always been closely associated with
witches, and for this reason seems to be of evil augury,
though in some parts of the country its foot, and sometimes
its head, are used as a protection against sorcery,
perhaps on the homeopathic principle.</p>

<p>The cat runs the hare very close in its association with
witches, and is a handy animal for transformation purposes,
being so frequently met with in this country.</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated Scottish witch-cat trials
took place at Caithness when Margaret Nin-Gilbert was
interrogated on February 8, 1719, by William Innes,
minister of Thurso, and confessed that she was travelling
one evening when she was met by the devil in the likeness
of a man who "engaged her to take on with him,"
which she agreed to do. From that time she became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
familiar with him, and sometimes he appeared to her in
the likeness of a huge black horse, sometimes riding a
horse, sometimes like a black cloud, and again in the shape
of a black hen. She apparently obtained the powers of
a witch with the help of this apparition, and the use she
made of them appears in the following story told by one
William Montgomery, a mason, whose house was invaded
by cats in such numbers that his wife and maidservant
could not endure to remain in the place.</p>

<p>One night on Montgomery's return he found five cats
by the fireside, and the servant told him they were
"speaking among themselves."</p>

<p>The cat-witch on the preceding November 28 had
climbed in at a hole in a chest, and Montgomery watched
his opportunity, intending to cut off her head when she
should put it out of the hole. "Having fastened my
sword on her neck," he continues, "which cut her, nor
could I hold her; having (at length) opened the chest,
my servant, William Geddes, having fixed my durk in
her hinder quarters by which stroke she was fastened to
the chest; yet after all she escaped out of the chest with
the durk in her hinder quarter, which continued there
till I thought, by many strokes, I had killed her with my
sword; and having cast her out dead, she could not be
found next morning." Four or five nights after, the
servant cried out that the cats had come again, and
Montgomery "wrapped his plaid about the cat and
thrust the durk through her body, and having fixed the
durk in the ground, I drove at her head with the back
of an axe until she was dead, and being cast out could
not be found next morning."</p>

<p>He further declared that no drop of blood came from
the cats, also that they did not belong to anyone in the
neighbourhood, although one night he saw eight of them
and took this to be witchcraft for certain.</p>

<p>On February 12, Margaret Nin-Gilbert, who lived
about half a mile from Montgomery's house, was seen by
some of her neighbours to drop one of her legs at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
own door, and she being suspected of witchcraft the leg,
black and putrefied, was taken before the deputy Sheriff
who immediately had the maimed woman arrested and
imprisoned. By her own confession she admitted that
she was bodily present at Montgomery's house "in the
likeness of a feltered cat" and that Montgomery had
broken her leg either with his durk or axe, which leg
since had fallen off from the other part of her body.
Also that one Margaret Olsone was also there in the
likeness of a cat, and several other women, and that they
were invisible because "the devil did hide and conceal
them by raising a dark mist or fog to screen them from
being seen."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the apparition of a witch as a cat foretells
death.</p>

<p>In 1607 a witch of the name of Isobel Grierson was
burnt after being accused and convicted of entering the
house of Adam Clark, in Prestonpans, in the likeness of
his own cat and in the company of a mighty rabble of
other cats, which by their noise frightened Adam, his
wife, and their maid, the last-named being dragged up
and down the stairs by the hair of her head, presumably
by the devil in the shape of a black man. Isobel also
visited the house of a certain Mr. Brown in the shape of
a cat, but once being called upon by name she vanished,
but Brown himself died of a disease she had laid upon
him.</p>

<p>In 1629 another Isobel, wife of George Smith, was
indicted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Item</i> she resett Cristian Grinton, a witch in her house,
whom the pannel's husband saw one night to come out
at one hole in the roof, in the likeness of a cat, and thereafter
transform herself in her own likeness, whereupon
the pannel told her husband that it should not fare well
with him, which fell out accordingly, for next day he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fell down dead at the plough."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The witches of Vernon frequented an old castle in
the shape of cats. Three or four brave men determined
to pass the night in the stronghold, where they were
assailed by the cats and one of them was killed, several
of the others being hurt, and many of the cats received
wounds. Afterwards the women were found to have
returned to human shape and suffered from corresponding
gashes.</p>

<p>The witches of Vernon had their imitators in three
witches of Strasburg who, in the disguise of huge cats,
fell upon a workman. He defended himself courageously
and chased away the cats, wounding them. They were
found instantaneously transformed into women, badly
hurt and in their beds.</p>

<p>Another story describes how several cat-witches tormented
a poor labourer, who, wearying of their persistence,
drew his broadsword and sent the animals flying.
One less nimble than the rest received a cut from the
sword which severed one of its hind legs, when, to the
labourer's amazement, he discovered on picking up the
limb that it was human in shape, and next morning one
of the old hags was discovered to have only one leg left.
Similar stories of the "repercussion" variety will be
found in Chapter XVIII, but they have never been
satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>M. Henri Gelin tells a good story of a witch who
transformed herself into a dog.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>One winter evening dogs were barking all round a
lonely house in Niort far more loudly than usual. The
farmer rose from his bed and carefully opened the shutters.
In the middle of the yard he saw a black and white
greyhound, which apparently was enjoying itself molesting
the other dogs, knocking them over with its paws
without the least difficulty, and then picking them up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in its jaws and throwing them to some distance as soon
as they ventured within reach. The farmer drew on
his trousers, into the seat of which his wife had sown a
horse-chestnut as a talisman against witchcraft, loaded
his gun and fired on the animal which fell dead. The
next day he rose at an early hour to go and examine the
corpse of his prey, and was greatly astonished to see the
body of a beautiful woman dressed in gorgeous clothes
lying in the very spot on which the dog was shot. Round
her neck there hung a rich chain made of five strings of
jewels bearing enamelled medallions beautifully chased,
and on her fingers were a profusion of precious gems.
In order to cover all traces of his involuntary murder,
he quickly dug a hole in a corner of the yard and made a
pile of faggots above the newly replaced earth. He had
only just finished his task when a gentleman came into
the yard, and asked whether he had seen a lady pass that
way. From the particulars given, the farmer soon felt
certain that the woman in question was the witch he
had killed. Tremblingly he replied that he had not seen
the lady. But a little dog that followed the gentleman
ran to the heap of faggots and began turning them over,
howling piteously. "You have killed my poor wife,"
cried the gentleman. "I am certain she came here."
But he did not insist on looking into the pile, and
presently withdrew, followed by the still whimpering
dog.</p>

<p>A sheep is sometimes, but not frequently, chosen as a
medium for transformation.</p>

<p>A man who was returning late from the market at
Verrières in Poitou, met a lamb, which followed him
bleating loudly, at the turn of a footpath crossing a
lonely heath. "Poor thing," he said, "you might be
devoured by a wolf," and, seizing the lamb by its four
legs, he hoisted it on to his shoulders, so as to carry it
conveniently. As he approached his house he found
the animal began to weigh very heavily. At last he
arrived in a perspiration and put down his burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
amongst the sheep which had already been penned in
the fold. At dawn the next day, he went to look at his
new lamb. But in the spot where he had placed it the
evening before he found a huge demon, busy stitching
straw soles into his shoes. The sorcerer had resumed
human shape and, looking very foolish, begged that he
would say nothing about his little adventure. But the
man seized him by the shoulders, kicked him from behind
and chucked him out of the pen, crying, "Get out of
this, you evil being." "If only he had made the slightest
scratch from which the blood flowed," added the old
lady who was telling the story, "the sorcerer would
have been cured, and would no longer have been able to
transform himself into an animal."</p>

<p>Although witches are able to transform themselves
into horses if they wish, they usually prefer to use their
powers for transforming other people, and getting the
benefit by riding their victims to death.</p>

<p>Margaret Grant, a Scottish witch of the nineteenth
century, believed that she was able to transform herself
into various animals, and "avers that she was, at times,
actually changed by evil-disposed persons into a pony
or a hare and ridden for great distances, or hunted by
dogs as the case might be."</p>

<p>Joseph Glanvill in his "Sadducismus Triumphatus,"
tells the story of a "great army of witches" who were
charged with performing a feat of horse-transformation
on a large scale at Blocula in Sweden in 1669.</p>

<p>A man may be transformed by a woman throwing a
magic halter over his head while he is in bed. Then
she mounts the horse, and rides to the witches' tryst.
If, however, the man-horse can manage to slip the magic
bridle off and throw it over her, she becomes a mare,
and her victim mounts her and rides till she is exhausted.</p>

<p>At Yarrowfoot a witch-mare, according to one story,
was shod in the usual manner and afterwards sold to her
own husband. To his surprise, when he removed the
bridle, his wife stood before him in human form, wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
horseshoes on her hands and feet.</p>

<p>There are many variants of this story, another woman
having been found in bed with horseshoe attachments,
and it is difficult to trace the origin of this fantastic idea.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Ostrel in Denmark a man
served on a farm, the mistress of which, unknown to
him, was a witch. Although she gave him good and
wholesome food he never thrived, but became thinner
every day. At this, being much troubled, he went
to a wise man, to whom he communicated his case.
From this man he learnt that his mistress was a witch
and that at night, while he slept, she transformed him
into a horse, and rode upon him to Troms Church in
Norway; so that it was not to be wondered at that his
strength decreased. The wise man at the same time
gave him an ointment with which to rub his head at
night, and said when he fell asleep he would have a
violent itching on his head, and then he would wake up
and see that he was standing outside Troms Church.</p>

<p>The man did as he had been told, and on waking up
the following night, he found that he was standing by
the church, holding in his hand a bridle which he had
torn off whilst scratching his head. Behind him he saw
many horses bound together by each other's tails.
Presently his mistress came out and cast a friendly look
at him, but he nodded for her to come nearer, and when
she stood by, he cast the bridle over her head and she
became a handsome mare on the spot. He mounted
and rode her home. On the way he called at a farrier's,
and made him shoe the mare. When he reached home
he told his master that he had been out to buy a fine
mare, which would go handsomely in harness with one
already in the stables. The master paid him a good
round sum for the animal, but when he took off its bridle,
there stood his wife with horseshoes on her hands and
feet. He turned her straight out of doors, but she never
managed to get rid of the horseshoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>When St. Macarius encountered a poor old woman
who had been changed into a horse, he restored her to
human shape by sprinkling holy water over her. The
same saint acted mercifully in another case of transformation.</p>

<p>A young girl refused to do the bidding of the man who
asked her to be his wife. He was so infuriated by her
refusal that he arranged with a wizard to turn her into a
stoat. A wise man, endeavouring to explain this incident,
says, "This was not a genuine transformation, but was
an illusion of the devil, who so affected the imagination
of the girl and the bystanders, that she appeared to them
in the form of a stoat, although she was still a woman in
reality."</p>

<p>The victim of the enchantment was then taken before
the holy man of the name of Macarius, who, on account of
his saintliness, could not suffer deception of the devil's
wiles. He looked upon the maiden and saw that she was
a human being and no stoat, and thus, uttering a prayer,
freed her from the spell. This cure is of the hypnotic
variety, in which several people are under the mental
spell of one other.</p>

<p>Reginald Scott tells the story of a woman who sold an
egg to a man who, when eating it, speedily turned into
an ass. For three years she rode the animal to market.
It was in the city of Salamin in Cyprus where a ship
arrived laden with merchandise. Many of the sailors
went ashore in the hope of procuring fresh provisions.
A certain sturdy young Englishman went to a woman's
shop some little way from the town, to see whether she
could let him have some new-laid eggs. She promised
to do so and went off to fetch them, but she was away
so long that the young sailor called out that she must
please make haste, as the tide was going out and he
might be left behind when his ship set sail. At last she
came out with the eggs and told him to come back to
her house if the ship had gone. The sailor made the best
of his way back to the vessel, but being hungry, ate an
egg on the way. He was then struck dumb and his wits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
seemed to have left him. When he reached the side of
the vessel and tried to go aboard, the mariners beat him
back with cudgels crying, "What lacks the ass?" and
"Whither the devil does the ass want to come?" Then
the sailor realised that he had been bewitched by the
woman's eggs he had eaten, and had turned into a
donkey. Finding it impossible to board the ship and
remembering the witch's words, he went back to her
house and there served her for the space of three years,
carrying the burdens she laid on his back.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Here no
doubt the egg is used merely as an instrument for inducing
a certain frame of mind in the victim. It may
be presumed that the witch's words of suggestion were
equally necessary in bringing about the transformation.</p>

<p>The sorceress Meroc in "The Metamorphosis or
Golden Ass of Apuleius," had the power to change, by
one word only, her lover into a beaver. "She likewise
changed into a frog an innkeeper who was her neighbour
and of whom she was on that account envious, and now
that old man, swimming in a tub of his own wine, and
merged in the dregs of it, calls on his ancient guests with
a hoarse and courteously croaking voice."</p>

<p>"She likewise changed one of the advocates of the
court into a ram because he had declaimed against her,
and now that ram pleads causes."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>M. Henri Gelin, whose researches on Poitevin legends
and folklore are very valuable,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> discusses the conditions
under which metamorphosis takes place, saying it is
entirely involuntary and is the result of an agreement
entered into with infernal powers. The soul of the
sorcerer is supposed to remain in a state of distinct
entity. But the narrators of these stories have done
little to make clear the actual process which takes place
when the transformation occurs of a man into a wolf, a
sheep, or a colt, or a woman (who seems to be credited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with gentler characteristics) into a goat, a bitch, or a
hind. Perhaps the human body remains temporarily
deprived of its soul, which, entering a new shape, substitutes
itself for the obscure and undeveloped soul of the
animal, or perhaps the wizard's body enjoys the faculty
of anatomically modifying its organs, and varying its
aspects something in the manner of the caterpillar which
turns into a moth. Who shall say?</p>

<p>A shepherdess in the district of Niort noticed when
driving her flock home that it had become augmented
by the presence of a black sheep, the origin of which she
could not trace. She penned up the extra animal with
her own in the shed, and bolted the door, rejoicing at
the addition to her flock. But as soon as night had
fallen, a woman's voice was heard singing in the sheep's
shed. The tune was a plaintive one, interspersed now
and again with strident and prolonged laughter. Not
one of the servants or neighbours dared to open the shed
and face the flock to see who could be singing like that.
In hushed voices they said "It's a witch!" The next
day at the usual hour of departure, the shepherdess, in
great dread of what she might see, partly opened the
shed door. The black sheep rushed like a whirlwind into
the open and was gone. Now and again, however, the
apparition returned to the farm in the shape of a woman,
clapping her hands and laughing loudly as though to
mock at the people who had allowed her to escape so
easily.</p>

<p>The following legend of a white hind comes from the
same district, Souché, two miles from Niort. Its
peculiar characteristic is that the young girl, who complains
to her mother about the hounds chasing her,
appears to be quite aware of what is happening to her
in her dual personality of woman and hind at the same
moment, an important detail when regarded in the light
of scientific occultism.</p>

<p>The story is told by Gelin and is very popular in
Poitou. The heroine is a girl by day and a white hind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
by night. The pack of hounds belonging to her brother
Renaud chase her in the forest. She complains of this
to her mother who begs Renaud to call back the pack.
But it is too late. The white hind is captured and killed.
Her palpitating flesh is stripped from the carcase and
prepared as a dish of venison, and next day when the
guests sit down to the feast, they are terrified to hear a
woman's voice which they recognise as that of their
absent sister, murmuring, "Alas! my breasts are lying
on platters of gold." Then, raising her tone, she announces
that Renaud's soul is forfeit and that his name
is written up on the gates of hell. At the sound of her
words Renaud falls down dead and his mother goes off
in a swoon.</p>

<p>"La Blanche Biche," as the story is called in the
original, is told in verse which may be rendered roughly
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Afar in the fields dwell a mother and daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother sings on, but the fair maid sighs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For what do you sigh, my dear Angèlique?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I sigh in great need, for my heart is sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the day I'm a maid, but at night a white hind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hounds are upon me and hunters as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the worst pack of all is my brother's pack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go forth, mother dear, to his castle and say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He must call back the hounds and the hunters too."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the mother puts her distaff aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And runs to the castle of Renaud, her son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell him to stay his hounds and his men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But my hounds, mother, are after the white hind now."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Call them back, Renaud, for sweet Angèlique<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwells in the shape of that same white hind."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Renaud seizes his hunter's horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But before he can blow two blasts loud and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white hind is taken and brought by the hounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the castle kitchen, where, seized by the cook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its joints are severed, its flesh is sliced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a shout comes from the castle hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Set a fine feast for us all to-night,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For a number of guests will honour our house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but our sister, the fair Angèlique."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the smoking dishes appear on the board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the guests turn longing eyes on the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a plaintive sigh is heard through the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a woman's sad voice rings out in a shriek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That curdles the blood of the waiting guests.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My breasts are lying on platters of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart's on the spit, and it groans and it moans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bright eyes, embedded in pastry, grow dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my soul dwells with angels in paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that of my brother is destined for hell!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At these terrible words, from invisible source,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renaud starts up! Then falls back&mdash;<i>stone dead</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his mother slips under the board in a swoon.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is a far more harrowing story than the Yorkshire
legend of a woman who turns into a white doe, which is
found in Wordsworth's "The White Doe of Rylstone."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Lady A&#259;liza mourned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her son, and felt in her despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pang of unavailing prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her son in Wharf's abysses drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noble boy of Egremound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which affliction, when God's grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length had in her heart found place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pious structure fair to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up this stately priory!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady's work,&mdash;but now laid low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the grief of her soul that doth come and go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the beautiful form of this innocent doe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is spotless, and holy, and gentle and bright&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glides o'er the earth like an angel of light.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Burke has a very different version of the famous and
spotless White Doe of Rylstone,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the animal being
gifted with human faculties rather than appearing in
human form, and the story having some affinity with those
of the fairy-godmother class. This beautiful white doe
belonged to Emily, the only daughter of Richard Norton
of Rylstone, who had nine warrior sons. The youngest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of them, Edward by name, had made a present of the
doe to his sister and the animal was called Blanche on
account of her spotless white skin. She followed her
young mistress everywhere and was like a human companion.
So great was her intelligence that she was
thought to be a benevolent witch or fairy, perhaps
rather a sprite bewitched in animal form.</p>

<p>One day she leads her mistress a long way from home,
to a spot beside a brooklet which is held by the people
of the neighbourhood to be haunted. Having reached
the desired destination, the doe lies down to rest and
Emily does likewise. Presently she falls into a kind of
dream, in which it seems to her that the brook boils and
bubbles up and a wraith of mist rises on the surface which
gradually takes the shape and outlines of a beautiful
woman.</p>

<p>This spirit warns Emily in a vision of coming disaster
to her beloved father and eight of her brothers. She
sees them done to death by the axe. Meanwhile the doe
lies immovable in a kind of trance and it may well be
thought that her real womanly self is seen by Emily in
its natural shape.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Emily is informed by Edward that
her father and eight of her brothers are on the point of
breaking out into open rebellion against the Sovereign of
England and that it is necessary for him to join them,
although doing so goes against his convictions, as he is
loyal to Queen Elizabeth. Nothing that Emily can do or
say dissuades him from his decision, and she parts from
him in great grief.</p>

<p>At first the rebels succeed in their projects, but
presently their attacks fail and they are forced to retreat.
A rumour reaches Emily that all the Nortons have been
captured and condemned to death and that the rebellion
is over.</p>

<p>In the hope of saving her father and brothers, Emily
sets out, accompanied by Blanche, to sue Queen Elizabeth
for pardon on behalf of her relatives. On the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and perilous journey to Court, Blanche again acts as her
adviser, and gives her almost human help in moments of
difficulty, and so charmed is the Queen by the beauty of
the suppliant and her intelligent animal comrade, that
she sends Lord Leicester post-haste to York with a
reprieve for the Nortons.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the messenger arrives too late to save
any member of the family except the youngest son,
Edward, Emily's favourite, and thus the beautiful human
doe is instrumental in saving him, at least, from the
scaffold.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
FAMILIARS</h3>


<p>From witch stories it is only a short step to stories about
witches' familiars, for nearly all sorcerers are gifted with
the power of sending out a spirit or second soul to do
the work of the evil one. A distinction has therefore
to be made between the witch in animal form and the
external soul of the witch sent forth in the shape of an
animal while she retains her human appearance.</p>

<p>The "familiar" or "imp," whether a real animal or
spirit in animal form, stands ever ready at the sorcerer's
elbow waiting to do his bidding. The "life" of the
familiar is bound up with that of the witch, and if the
former be wounded, the latter will suffer from an injury
in a corresponding part of the body. Death to the
familiar means death to the witch, and the way to get
rid of the spell is to kill the double of the witch. To
this class belong some of the most interesting phenomena,
as well as the most inexplicable, dealing with the human
animal theory.</p>

<p>In one case a blue butterfly was seen to flutter over
a certain farm, and as affairs there had not been going
at all well, it was looked upon with dread and suspicion
as the bringer of evil. For three weeks the insect hovered
about and during that period "no butter came." Then
the farmer decided to take steps to break the enchantment.
Armed with a wet towel he sallied forth to chase
the alleged familiar and, cleverly flapping his cloth, he
brought down the butterfly at a swoop. Precisely at that
moment a woman, who was suspected of being a witch,
was found lying dead outside the door of her house close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
by, and after the double event there was no further
trouble with the churning.</p>

<p>Matthew Hopkins of Manningtree, Essex, a witch-finder
of ill-fame, was the cause of bringing thousands of
supposed witches to judgment and so to the stake. He
was paid 20s. in each town he visited and managed to
rid of its suspicious characters, and he appears to have
found his profession extraordinarily lucrative. In 1644
he was commissioned by Parliament to make a circuit
through several counties with a view to discovering
witches. He travelled in the company of several boon
companions for three years and was instrumental in
having sixteen persons hanged at Yarmouth, forty at
Bury and at least sixty in other parts of Suffolk, Norfolk
and Huntingdonshire.</p>

<p>During a notorious trial of a number of witches at
Chelmsford, Essex, on July 29th, 1645, Hopkins made a
deposition about an alleged witch, Elizabeth Clarke,
who confessed that she had known the devil intimately
for more than six years and that he visited her between
three and five times a week. She invited Hopkins and
his companions, one of whom was a man called Sterne,
to stay at her house for a time until she could call up
one of her white imps for them to see. Presently there
appeared on the scene an imp like a dog, white and with
sandy spots, which seemed to be very fat and plump, with
short legs. The animal forthwith vanished away. The
said Elizabeth gave the name of this imp as Jarmara.
And immediately afterwards there appeared another
imp, which she called Vinegar Tom, in the shape of a
greyhound with long legs. The said Elizabeth then
remarked that the next imp should be black in colour
and that it should come for Master Sterne (the other
witness already mentioned), and it appeared as she
promised, but presently vanished without leaving a sign.
The last imp of all to come before the spectators was a
creature in the shape of a polecat, but the head somewhat
bigger. The said Elizabeth then disclosed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
informant that she had five imps of her own. And two
other imps with which she had dealings belonged to a
certain Beldame Anne West.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The said Matthew Hopkins, when going from the
house of a Mr. Edwards of Manningtree, to his own
house, one night between nine and ten o'clock, accompanied
by his favourite greyhound, noticed the dog give
a sudden leap and run off as though in full course after a
hare. Hastening to see what the greyhound pursued so
eagerly, he espied a white thing about the size of a kitten,
and the panting dog was standing aloof from the creature.
By and by the imp or kitten began to dance about and
around the said greyhound and, viciously approaching
him, bit or tore a piece of flesh off the dog's shoulder.</p>

<p>Coming later into his own yard, the informant saw a
black thing proportioned like a cat, only that it was
thrice as big, sitting on a strawberry bed and fixing its
luminous eyes on him. But when he went towards it, it
leaped suddenly over the palings and ran towards the
informant as he thought, but instead, it fled through the
yard with his greyhound in hot pursuit after it to a
great gate which was "underset with a pair of tumbrell
strings," and it did throw the said gate wide open and
then vanished. And the said greyhound returned again
to the informant shaking and trembling exceedingly.</p>

<p>Sterne gave evidence on the same day, and much to
the same effect, but said that the white imp was like a
cat but not so big, and when he asked Elizabeth whether
she was not afraid of her imps she answered, "What!
do you think I am afraid of my children?" and she called
the imp Jarmara as having red spots, and spoke of two
more called Sack and Sugar. Four other witnesses confirmed
the story practically in its entirety.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Clarke herself gave evidence then, and said
Anne West had sent her a "thing like a little kitlyn,"
which would obtain food for her. Two or three nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
after this promise, a white thing came to her in the night,
and the night after a grey one spoke to her and said it
would do her no hurt and would help her to get a husband.
After various charges against the said Elizabeth Clarke and
her accomplice, Elizabeth Gooding, Anne Leech, a third
woman accused of witchcraft, deposed on April 14th
that she and the other two accused sent their respective
grey, black and white imps to kill cattle belonging to
various neighbours, and that later they had sent them
to kill neighbours' children and she added that her imps
spoke to her in a hollow voice which she plainly understood,
and that these accused witches had met together
at the house of the said Elizabeth Clarke, when a book
was read "wherein she thinks there was no goodness."</p>

<p>Another woman suspected of witchcraft was Helen
Clark who confessed on April 11th that the devil had
appeared to her in the likeness of a white dog, and that
she called her familiar Elimanzer and that she fed him
with milk-pottage and that he spoke to her audibly and
bade her deny Christ.</p>

<p>With the witch Anne West was implicated her daughter
Rebecca West, who, however, was acquitted, and the
notorious Matthew Hopkins deposed that she had told
him of visiting the house of Clarke with her mother,
and that they had found Leech, Gooding, and Helen
Clark, and that the devil had appeared in the shape of a
dog, afterwards in the shape of two kittens, then in the
shape of two dogs, and that the said familiars did homage
in the first place to the said Elizabeth Clarke and slipped
up into her lap and kissed her, and then went and kissed
all that were in the room except the said Rebecca, who
was then made to swear on a book that she would not
reveal what she saw or heard&mdash;on pain of the torments
of hell, and that afterwards the devil came and kissed
her and promised to marry her, and she sent him to kill
a neighbour's child, of the name of Hart, who died
within a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Susan Sparrow, who gave her evidence on the 25th of
April, said that the house in which she lived with one
Mary Greenleif, was haunted by a leveret which usually
came and sat before the door, which, when coursed by a
dog, never stirred, "and just when the dog came at it,
he skipped over it and turned about and stood still, and
looked on it, and shortly after that the dog languished
and died."</p>

<p>Another of the witches, called Margaret Moone, had
a familiar "in the likeness of a rat for bigness and shape,
but of a greyer colour." She confessed to two of the
witnesses that she had twelve imps and called these by
such names as Jesus, Jockey, Mounsier, Sandy, Mrs.
Elizabeth, and Collyn, etc. Moone was a "woman of
very bad fame," who confessed to many crimes, especially
of causing the death of animals and children.</p>

<p>Rose Hallybread, who died in gaol before execution,
was accused of being implicated with Joyce Boanes in
sending four familiars to the house of a carpenter,
Robert Turner, whose servant was then taken sick and
"crowed perfectly like a cock, sometimes barked like a
dog," sang tunes, groaned, and struggled with such
strength that five strong men were needed to hold him.
Boanes confessed that her imp made the victim bark
like a dog, Hallybread's imp caused him "to sing sundry
tunes in great extremity of pains," and Susan Cork
compelled him to crow. The torture was inflicted
because Turner's servant had refused to give Susan Cork
a sack full of chips.</p>

<p>Anne Cate, another of the witches who was executed
at Chelmsford, said she had three familiars like mice
and a fourth like a sparrow. They were called James,
Prickeare, Robyn, and Sparrow, and she sent them to
kill both cattle and human beings.</p>

<p>It was thought impossible to kill these familiars, and
one Goff, a glover and very honest man of Manningtree,
confessed to passing Anne West's house about four
o'clock on a moonlight morning and seeing her door
was open, he looked into the house. "Presently there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
came three or four little things in the shape of black
rabbits leaping and skipping about him, who, having a
good stick in his hand, struck at them thinking to kill
them, but could not, but at last caught one of them in
his hand, and holding it by the body, he beat the head
of it against his stick, intending to beat the brains out
of it; but when he could not kill it that way, he took
the body in one hand and the head in another and endeavoured
to wring off the head, and as he wrung and
stretched the neck of it, it came out between his hands
like a lock of wool." Then he tried to drown it in a
spring, but kept falling down. At last he crept to the
water on hands and knees, holding the familiar under the
water for a good space. But as soon as he let go it
sprang out of the water up into the air and so vanished.</p>

<p>He went and asked Anne West why she had set her
imps on him to molest and trouble him, but she said
"they were sent out as scouts upon another design."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Joan Cariden, widow, examined September 25, 1645,
said, that about three-quarters of a year ago, as she was
in bed about twelve or one of the clock in the night
there lay a rugged soft thing on her bosom which was
very soft, and she thrust it off with her hand; and she
said that when she had thrust it away she thought God
forsook her, for she could never pray so well as she could
before, and further she said that she verily thought it
was alive. Examined further, she said the Devil came to
her in the shape of a black rugged dog in the night-time
and crept into bed with her and spoke to her in mumbling
language. The next night he came again and required
her to deny God and lean on him.</p>

<p>Jane Hott, widow and associate of the above, also
examined on September 25, 1645, confessed that a thing
like a hedgehog had usually visited her, and when it lay
on her breast she struck it off with her hand, and that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
was as soft as a cat.</p>

<p>In 1664 one Elizabeth Style, a widow, of Bayford, was
examined at Stoke Trister, Somerset, before Robert
Hunt, for witchcraft.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses, Nicholas Lambert, examined on
January 26 of that year, deposed to having watched the
prisoner in company with William Thick and William
Read of Bayford. The informant sat near the prisoner
by the fire at three o'clock in the morning and was
reading "The Practice of Piety," when he noticed
"there came from her head a glistening bright fly about
an inch in length, which pitched at first in the chimney
and then vanished. In less than a quarter of an hour
after, there appeared two flies more, of a less size and
another colour, which seemed to strike at the informant's
hand in which he held his book, but missed it. He looked
steadfastly at the prisoner and perceived her countenance
to change and to become very black and ghastly,
the fire also at the same time changing its colour; whereupon
the informants, Thick and Read, conceiving that
her familiar was then about her, looked at her poll, and
seeing her hair shake very strangely, took it up, and then
a fly like a great Millar flew out from the place and
pitched on the table board and then vanished away."
When asked what it was that flew out of her poll the
accused said it was a butterfly, and asked them why
they had not caught it. She confessed that it was her
familiar and that was the usual time when her familiar
came to her.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>One Alice Duke, <i>alias</i> Manning, of Wincanton, in
Somerset, who was tried in 1664 for witchcraft, confessed
that her familiar visited her "in the shape of a
little cat of a dunnish colour, which is as smooth as a
want," and that "her familiar doth commonly suck
her right breast about seven at night," when she fell
into a kind of trance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret and Phillip Flower, daughters of Joan Flower,
were tried for witchcraft near Belvoir Castle and executed
at Lincoln on March 11, 1618, on the most extraordinary
charges.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Phillip Flower, examined on the 4th of February
previously, said that her mother and sister "maliced"
the Earl of Rutland, his Countess and their children,
because her sister Margaret was put out of the ladies'
service of laundry. Phillip thereupon brought from the
Castle the right glove of the Henry Lord Ross and gave
it to her mother, "who presently rubbed it on the back
of her spirit Rutterkin, and then put it into hot boiling
water, afterwards she pricked it often and buried it in
the yard, wishing Lord Ross might never thrive, and so
her sister Margaret continued with her mother, where
she often saw the cat Rutterkin leap on her shoulder and
suck her neck."</p>

<p>Margaret corroborated the story, and added that
after the sorcery Lord Ross fell sick within a week. She
also said that her mother and she and her sister agreed
to bewitch the Earl and Countess so that they might
have no more children, being angry with the Countess
for telling her she was no longer to live at the Castle, and
who, giving her forty shillings, a bolster and a mattress,
bade her sleep at home.</p>

<p>Then she took wool from the mattress and a pair of
gloves given her by one of the Castle servants and put
them into warm water, mingling them with some blood
and stirring it together. Then she took the wool and
gloves out of the water and rubbed them on the body of
Rutterkin, the cat, saying the Lord and Lady should
have no more children or it should be long first.</p>

<p>She further confessed that her mother told her to
bring a piece of Lady Katherine's&mdash;the earl's daughter's&mdash;kerchief,
and her mother put it in hot water and taking
it out rubbed it on Rutterkin, "bidding him fly and go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Whereupon Rutterkin whined and cried "mew," and
she said Rutterkin had no power to hurt Lady Katherine.</p>

<p>Examined on the 25th of February, before Francis
Earl of Rutland, Francis Lord Willoughby of Eresby,
Sir George Manners, and Sir William Pelham, Phillip
Flower confessed to having a familiar spirit in the form
of a white rat, and gave her soul to it, and it promised
to do her good and cause one Thomas Simpson to love
her.</p>

<p>The mother of these girls, Margaret Flower, being
examined at the same time and place, confessed to two
familiar spirits, one white and the other spotted black.</p>

<p>She further said she had been visited in Lincoln gaol
by four devils, between eleven o'clock and midnight,
about the 30th January. One stood at the foot of her
bed, with a black head like an ape, and spoke to her,
though she could not understand his meaning. The
other three were the cat Rutterkin, Little Robin, and
Spirit. She confirmed what her daughters had said about
Lord Ross, and said that after she rubbed the glove on
the spirit Rutterkin she threw it into the fire and burnt
it.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses, Anne Baker of Rothsford, who
was concerned in the case of the death of Lord Ross,
son of the Earl of Rutland, when examined on March
1st, 1618, by the Earl and Sir George Manners and
Samuel Fleming, Doctor of Divinity, made the following
curious statements in the course of her confession of
witchcraft.</p>

<p>She said she saw a hand appear to her and heard a
voice in the air say "Anne Baker, save thyself, for tomorrow
thou and thy master must be slain," and the
next day her master and she were in a cart together and
suddenly she saw a flash of fire, and said her prayers, and
the fire went away, and shortly after a crow came and
perched upon her clothes, and she said her prayers again
and bade the crow <i>to go to whom he was sent</i>, and the crow
went to her master and did beat him to death, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
with her prayers recovered him to life, but he was sick a
fortnight after, and if she had not had more knowledge
than he, both of them, and the cattle, would have been
killed.</p>

<p>Another witness at the same trial, Joan Willimott,
confessed to having a spirit she called Pretty, and she
declared that a shepherd, Gamaliel Greete, had a spirit
like a white mouse put into him in his swearing; and
that if he did look upon anything with an intent to hurt
it it should be hurt, and she said further that in the
home of the Flowers she had seen two spirits, one like
a rat and the other like an owl.</p>

<p>The basic belief that it is possible to send forth a
familiar to wreak harm on others is found fully developed
in black magic, and to such occult powers no
doubt many strange phenomena may be attributed.</p>

<p>A peculiarly uncanny story about a witch and her
familiar comes from Poitou. A young man who lived
near Champdenois, went to spend the evening with
some friends. He was jumping over a stone fence which
separated the neighbouring estates, when a familiar
settled on his back. The young man caught hold of the
demon with all his strength and strangled him, flinging
him on the ground, where he lay apparently lifeless.
Curiosity induced the young man to lift the inert body
on to his shoulders, as he wished to look at it by candlelight
and show it to his friends.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his friends' house the inmates were
sitting in a circle about the hearth and the mistress of
the house was spinning, surrounded by her maids. They
all looked wonderingly at the demon, but the mistress
appeared to be strangely ill at ease.</p>

<p>"I believe," said the young fellow, "it's a sorcerer.
There's only one way of finding out. We'll put it in
the fire, then we shall know what sort of being it is."</p>

<p>When she heard this cruel suggestion the mistress
gripped the arms of her chair in obvious anxiety and let
her spindle drop to the ground, saying she was feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
very ill. When the demon was put on to the glowing
cinders she shrieked out and was forced to confess, in a
shamefaced manner, that she had been wandering in the
woods that evening in the shape of an animal, and that
the young man had captured her double. Whether this
witch intended to work harm is not divulged.</p>

<p>The Kaju wizards make familiars by digging up a
corpse and giving it medicine, which restores it to life.
They run a hot needle up the back of the head and slit
the tongue. The familiar then speaks with inarticulate
sound and is sent out by them to do harm. This is
probably another form of ritual akin to black magic.</p>

<p>A beautiful enchantress and priestess lived among the
natives of Nicaragua and was served by many animals
over whom she had extraordinary powers. She also had
in her service an old man and woman. She transformed
them into youthful beings, with large expanding pinions,
and clothed them in tiger- and deer-skins, adorned with
richly coloured plumage.</p>

<p>Another and more exalted form of the familiar was
the Daemon or Genius, a kind of spirit which, according
to the beliefs of the ancients, presided over the actions
of mankind. Man was thus said to have a good and an
evil presiding spirit. The genius of Socrates, for instance,
constantly gave him information and kept him
from the commission of crime or impiety.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION IN FOLK-LORE AND FAIRY-TALE</h3>


<p>In folk-lore and mythological legends all animals are
originally human and most human beings are able to
turn into animals. Women who married tigers, women
who gave birth to serpents, men who became goats,
cows or sheep, frog-princes and monkey-servants, abound
in the standard fairy-tales of almost every country.</p>

<p>Grecian women are said to change their cold lovers
into donkeys, Persian princesses, on the contrary, cause
their too passionate adorers to metamorphose into
numerous animal shapes and Circe, disgusted with the
depraved conduct of the companions of Ulysses, changed
them into swine and shut them up in sties. The story
of Circe typifies, of course, the fact that man's lower
nature is the animal part of him, and the story of
Malec Muhammed, which follows, points the same
moral.</p>

<p>A repetition of the well-known Circe story needs no
apology in a book which deals at length with the subject
of transformation. Circe was the daughter of Sol and
Perse, and was celebrated for her skill in magic. She
married a prince of Colchis, and then murdered him to
obtain his kingdom. Being expelled by her subjects for
her crime, she was carried away by her father to Aea, an
island on the coast of Italy, which Ulysses visited on his
return from the Trojan War. His companions, giving
way to excess, were changed into swine by Circe's magic
potions. Ulysses was himself made immune from her
spells by a herb called Moly, given to him by the god
Mercury, and he demanded that his companions should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
be restored. Circe complied with his request. Eurylochus
and his companions found Circe's palace in an
open space in a wood, and Ulysses had the following
account from the lips of Eurylochus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All about were wolves and lions," he said, "yet
these harmed not the men, but stood up on their hind-legs,
fawning upon them, as dogs fawn upon their master
when he comes from his meal, because he brings the
fragments with him that they love. And the men were
afraid. And they stood in the porch and heard the voice
of Circe as she sang with a lovely voice and plied the
loom. Then said Polites (who was dearest of all his
comrades to Ulysses), 'Someone within plies a loom,
and sings with a loud voice. Some goddess is she, or
woman. Let us make haste and call.'</p>

<p>"So they called to her, and she came out and beckoned
to them that they should follow. So they went, in
their folly. And she bade them sit, and mixed for them
a mess, red wine, and in it barley meal and cheese and
honey, and mighty drugs withal, of which, if a man
drank, he forgot all that he loved. And when they had
drunk she smote them with her wand. And lo! they had
of a sudden the heads and the voices and the bristles of
swine, but the heart of a man was in them still. And
Circe shut them in sties, gave them mast and acorns and
cornel to eat."</p>

<p>And Eurylochus fled back to the ship to tell Ulysses
what had befallen his comrades.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Circe also changed Picus into a bird, when he did not
respond to her advances.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When love from Picus Circe could not gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him with her charming wand and hellish bane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed to a bird and spots his speckled wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sundry colours....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Geti Afraz, the heroine of a typical Eastern transformation
story, on the other hand, changes Malec
Muhammed the moment he grows too ardent in his
caresses.</p>

<p>One day when Malec was on his travels, he arrived at
the city of Ekbalia and took up his lodging in a caravanserai.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>At dusk that evening he saw a remarkable illumination
in the sky and heard intoxicating music. Presently a
procession of beautifully dressed people passed by, and
he caught a glimpse of a lovely princess. "Who is
she?" he asked of the neighbours. "Geti Afraz, daughter
of the King of the Peris, is riding through the city,"
they answered. "Her palace is close by."</p>

<p>Entranced by the beauty of her appearance, Malec
Muhammed inquired whether she received visitors.
"Yes, she does," was the answer; "but it is at their
own risk, as she usually changes her visitors into the
shape of some animal." Malec, nothing daunted by
this strange remark, set out at once for the abode of the
princess.</p>

<p>The door of the palace was shut, and knocking loudly
he cried, "Open to Malec Muhammed." The Peri's
reputation was well-known, and no one ever arrived at
the palace who was not brave enough to risk being turned
into an animal. In a moment the door was opened and
Malec was invited to step inside.</p>

<p>In the reception hall he saw a throne composed of a
single jacinth, adorned with the richest cushions, on
which was seated a lady, beautiful as the silver moon,
surrounded by a thousand handmaids, brilliant as stars.</p>

<p>Malec stood stupefied in wonder at this vision of
paradise. The princess pointed to a golden seat near
the throne, and when he sat upon it she asked, "Whence
come you, who are you, and why have you visited me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Malec Muhammed answered like one in a dream,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Drunk with the wine of love I roam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This path and seek no other home."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then Geti Afraz ordered one of her handmaidens to
bring some ruby-coloured wine to her guest, and after
he had taken it she asked whether the company of the
maiden would give him entertainment. But he refused
her offer, saying that his devotion to herself prevented
him talking to, or even looking at, any other woman.</p>

<p>The princess seemed pleased with this compliment,
but said in a pensive tone, "Man is an impatient creature
and from his impatience many misfortunes result which
he lays to our charge." Malec replied that whilst in her
presence he could never give way to impatience for, if
he were allowed to gaze into her adorable eyes, life needed
nothing more to make it perfect.</p>

<p>Geti Afraz smiled sarcastically, saying, "I fear you
will not remain satisfied gazing for ever into my eyes,
and take heed, for if you show the least tendency to lose
your head over me you will be punished by being banished
from my society."</p>

<p>Thus they spent many hours in each other's company,
he gazing into her eyes but never presuming even so far
as to touch her hand.</p>

<p>Overcome by her beauty, at last he threw himself at
her feet and asked whether the lifelong devotion he
was prepared to offer was acceptable in her sight. "Be
patient and cautious," she said, to calm his protestations,
"otherwise you will be transformed into an
animal, which is not an easy matter to remedy."</p>

<p>So Malec went back to his golden seat and mastered
his passionate feelings as well as he could. Just then one
of the handmaidens brought in a scented rose to present
to the princess. Malec Muhammed led her forward in
hopes that his fingers might chance to touch those of
Geti Afraz. The princess stretched out her hand to
take the rose when Malec Muhammed lost his self-control
and planted an impassioned kiss upon her fingers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
"Ah! you cursed billing dove!" cried Geti Afraz,
"Why do you do that?" and at her words Malec gave
a sudden spring into the air and whirled round and round
in the form of a dove.</p>

<p>The poor bird was desperate on account of this strange
way in which his affection had been received. All day
long he flew from turret to turret, and hopped from
branch to branch, before his unrelenting mistress; but
finding his appeals no use he flew away and took the
quickest road to his house. There his servants set traps
to catch him, and he fluttered about in great fear, until
one remarked, "Poor little dove, let it go, for the love
of our master, who has not been seen here for some days."</p>

<p>Malec then flew to the house of his uncle, the Vizier,
and perched on his knee. The Vizier, suspecting enchantment,
sent for a box of medicine and inserted a
dose in the bird's bill; the dove fluttered round and round
in a circle and suddenly resumed human form.</p>

<p>But the attraction of the princess proved too much
for Malec, and though he tried to forget her he found
it impossible. At last, in desperation, he cried out that
he must see her again, cost what it might.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Make me a dog, make me an ass,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From her presence ne'er shall pass<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her fond adorer!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he exclaimed as he set out once more for the palace.</p>

<p>He was admitted into the presence of the princess,
who expressed great surprise at the fate which had overtaken
him.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "it was hard to be so severely punished
for one kiss of those charming fingers."</p>

<p>"Well," she replied, "I approve of you so well that
to compensate you for your misfortune I will give you
leave to kiss both my hands and my feet as often as you
please, but you must not presume any further than
that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening he was allowed to stay beside her couch,
because when she suggested sending him away he reminded
her of her promise. How could he kiss her hands
and her feet if he was forced to leave her side? This
concession made Malec believe that she had more affection
for him than she was willing to show. "I asked her
only for the opportunity of admiring her at a distance
and she has given me a place close beside her," he
thought.</p>

<p>Hour after hour he kissed her hands and feet, and all
the time he aspired to her lips. There she lay slumbering,
beautiful as a goddess, and as he bent over her to approach
his lips to hers, she awoke and reminded him of his
promise, saying, "Be cautious, or you will have to take
your departure."</p>

<p>At this rebuke he retired ignominiously from her side,
but his love for her increased by leaps and bounds, and
she fostered it by walking with him in the lovely palace
gardens and by taking him with her in her gorgeous
carriage when she followed the hounds. In the evening
they feasted, and, after quaffing wine, Malec, driven to
madness by her beauty, forgot himself as she lay slumbering
and, bending forward, pressed his lips to hers.</p>

<p>At that moment she awoke, crying, "Cursed ass! what
have you done?"</p>

<p>Even as she uttered the words, Malec gave a spring
and galloped away in the form of an ass.</p>

<p>The servants of the princess beat the animal with
sticks and drove him out of the palace.</p>

<p>After nine long months, in which Malec endured the
ignominy of being in animal form, his uncle, who had been
greatly annoyed by his nephew's repeated folly, softened
sufficiently to help him out of his dilemma, by giving
him a further dose of the magic medicine which brought
him back to his natural appearance.</p>

<p>When once again he arrived at the palace Geti Afraz
welcomed him warmly.</p>

<p>"All that has befallen you has happened through your
own impatience," she said. "What can a man expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
who loses his self-control as you did?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless the princess bound him to her in flowery
chains, which entangled him more and more, until the
tortured Malec, whilst visiting King Anushah in her
company, exceeded the limits of propriety she had laid
down for him and was turned into an ox.</p>

<p>In this form he was set to draw water, and tears trickled
down his ox-like face at the indignities he had to undergo.
His uncle, seeing the animal's distress, said, "Malec
Muhammed, if this be you, make some sign to let me
know!"</p>

<p>The ox nodded as a sign.</p>

<p>"The curse of God light on you and your doings,"
said the Vizier, and he had the ox driven to a stall and
ordered his servants to fatten him up for the winter,
when he intended to make mince-meat of him.</p>

<p>After six months had passed, however, King Anushah
interfered and asked the Vizier to pardon Malec's folly.
Enough medicine was sent for to serve its purpose even
if Malec had been metamorphosed a hundred times and
he was called into his uncle's presence.</p>

<p>"Gallows face!" cried the Vizier, "this time you
must thank the Shah that you are to become a man once
more, for <i>I</i> should have let you die in disgrace. If you
take an oath never to behave so foolishly again I will
give you the medicine."</p>

<p>The ox pleaded and nodded, the dose was administered
and Malec became himself again.</p>

<p>"Really," said the Shah, "you have made a beast of
yourself often enough, Muhammed," and he made him
promise not to do it again.</p>

<p>But even then Malec had not learnt wisdom, and
after many vicissitudes, when he was brought once more
into the presence of his charmer, he found her fascination
too much for his senses.</p>

<p>The languid Narcissus-like eyes of Geti Afraz yielded
to slumber after a banquet, and she fell asleep on her
sofa with Malec by her side. In tenderest mood he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
rained kiss after kiss upon her lips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bless the sweet power of wine," he cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That seals so sound her lovely eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unable to restrain himself further he laid one hand upon
her lily-white bosom, and she started up with the cry,
"Cursed dog, what are you doing?" and he became
a dog.</p>

<p>For many months Malec endured this new indignity,
for his uncle, the Vizier, declared that he should wear a
dog's collar round his neck till the day of his death, but
the princess herself, relenting of the cruel fate to which
she had condemned her lover, contrived that the Shah's
wife, Ruh Afza, should transform her husband into an
animal in order that he might suffer what Malec was
suffering.</p>

<p>As soon as the Shah offered his caresses to her, Ruh
Afza cried out:</p>

<p>"Ha! you cat, what? Would you scratch me?"
and immediately the Shah found himself whirled round
and round, and, taking a spring with his head down and
his heels up, he assumed the form of a cat. All the rest
of the night he strolled through the garden caterwauling
piteously.</p>

<p>In the morning he met the Vizier, who recognised
his master, King Anushah, at once, and restored him to
his normal condition.</p>

<p>The Shah, wishing to vent his anger on Geti Afraz for
this insult to his dignity, decided to execute Malec, "to
sear her bosom with a lasting wound," for he believed
her to be fond of Malec in spite of her conduct. Sending
for the poor dog he lashed the animal severely.</p>

<p>Then, in his pain, Malec cried out to his enchantress
to rescue him from danger, and she relented, restoring
him to human form and rewarding him with her love.</p>

<p>One of the best descriptions of transformation by use
of ointments, in which details of the process are given,
is to be found in "The Metamorphosis or Golden Ass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of Apuleius," in which Lucius, the hero, happening to
use the wrong salve, transforms himself into a donkey
instead of into a bird as he intended. The manner in
which he has to resume human shape is by partaking of
rose leaves.</p>

<p>Lucius witnesses the transformation of Pamphile into
a bird. Watching through the chink of the door leading
to her chamber he sees Pamphile divest herself of her
garments and after opening a certain small chest, take
several boxes therefrom, uncover one of them and rub
herself for a long time with the ointment, from the soles
of her feet to the crown of her head. Holding a lamp
in her hand she uttered a long incantation, and then
shook her limbs with a tremulous agitation; and from
these, lightly fluctuating, soft feathers extended and
strong wings burst forth, her nose hardened and incurvated,
the nails were compressed and made crooked, and
Pamphile turned into an owl. Giving voice to a querulous
sound, she made trial of her new attributes, gradually
leaping from the earth, and soon after, being raised on
high, she flew out of doors with all the force of her
wings. Thus she was voluntarily changed by her own
magic arts.</p>

<p>Lucius then asked Pamphile's maid, Fotis, for a little
ointment from the same box, as he much desired to
experience a similar transformation. At first Fotis
demurred, but at last agreed to do what he asked, telling
him that a change back to human form could be effected
by "small and frivolous herbs," such as dill put into
fountain water, with the leaves of the laurel given as a
lotion, and also to drink.</p>

<p>The matter being decided, Fotis went into the bedchamber
of her mistress and fetched a box of ointment
from the chest, which she brought to Lucius, who thus
tells the story of what took place.</p>

<p>"Having obtained the box from Fotis, and having
prayed that transformation would favour me with
prosperous flights, I hastily divested myself of all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
garments, and having ardently put my hand into the
box and taken from it a sufficient quantity of the ointment,
I rubbed with it the members of my body. And
now, balancing my arms with alternate efforts, I longed
to be changed into a bird. No plumes, however, germinated,
but my hairs became evidently thickened into
bristles, my tender skin was hardened into a hide, and
the extremities of my hands, all my fingers having lost
their number, coalesced into several hoofs and a long tail
proceeded from the extremity of my spine. My face
was now enormous, my mouth was long, and my limbs
immoderate and pendant. Thus, also, my ears increased
excessively, and were clothed with rough hairs. And
while destitute of all hope, I consider the whole of my
body, I see that I am not a bird, but an ass; and, complaining
of the deed of Fotis, but being deprived both of
the human gesture and voice, I silently expostulated with
her (which was all I could do) with my underlip hanging
down, and beheld her sternly and obliquely yet with
humid eyes. But she, as soon as she beheld me thus
changed, struck her forehead with her indignant hands,
and exclaimed, 'Wretch that I am, I am undone.
Trepidation, and at the same time festination, have
beguiled me, and the similitude of the boxes has deceived
me. It is well, however, that a remedy for this transformation
may be easily obtained; for by only chewing
roses you will put off the form of an ass and will immediately
become again my Lucius. And I wish I had
prepared for this evening, according to my custom, some
garlands of roses, for then you would not have suffered
the delay of even one night. But as soon as it is morning,
a remedy shall hastily be procured for you.' After this
manner she lamented. But I thought I was a complete
ass, and instead of Lucius a labouring beast, yet
I retained human sense."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Lucius deliberated whether he should kick and bite
Fotis to death, but was only deterred by the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
that if he did so he would not be able to return to
human shape, so he ran to the stable and spent the night
with the horses there. But unfortunately he was driven
off by a band of robbers, and under these circumstances,
necessarily abstaining from roses which he could not get,
he was forced to continue under the form of an ass, in
which he had numerous adventures.</p>

<p>A most remarkable series of transformations occurs in
the Welsh romance "The History of Taliesin," written
about the thirteenth century. Caridwen, who is boiling
a charmed mixture from which she hopes to secure "the
three blessed drops of the grace of inspiration," for her
ugly and deformed son, leaves her cauldron for a moment,
in which space of time one of her servants unfortunately
obtains the benefit of her wisdom. In her anger she
threatens him and he, in fear, takes to his heels. She
gives chase and he changes into a hare. Then she becomes
a greyhound and gains on him. Throwing himself
into the river he takes the form of a fish, and she, as an
otter, pursues him, and he assumes the shape of a bird.
She follows him as a hawk. Then he drops to earth upon
a heap of winnowed wheat, disguising himself as a grain.
Caridwen transforms herself into a high-crested black
hen and scratches among the wheat till she sifts him out
and swallows him.</p>

<p>These kaleidoscopic changes are positively bewildering
and may be regarded as purely symbolic. They contrast
with the simple and pathetic transformation which
follows.</p>

<p>The Ebesoana race among the Arawaks of Guiana, take
their name from "Ebesotu," the transformed heroine
of the following legend:&mdash;</p>

<p>A love-sick maiden prayed her father, a sorcerer, to
transform her into a dog, so that she might follow
her lover, who had been utterly indifferent to her
charms.</p>

<p>Her father treated the affair very practically indeed,
in spite of the fact that he thought his daughter very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
foolish.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Take this skin," he said sadly, "and draw o'er thy shoulders,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be rid of thy madness&mdash;then come back to me!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The young lover, who was a huntsman, used to start
out every morning into the woods, followed by four
dogs, but when he returned in the evening only three
of them were at heel, for one always ran home when it
came to the point of slaughtering the prey. When the
hunter reached his cottage he found it swept and clean,
the fire burning, and bread freshly baked, and he
imagined a kind neighbour had done this for him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When they all denied it, he said, ''Tis some spirit,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose look was so strange it puzzled his mind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Next day, when he noticed there were only three
dogs instead of four, he tied the hounds to a tree and
went in search of the missing animal. Peeping through
a crack in the door of his cottage he saw a lovely maiden,
and the dogskin lying over a chair close by. Making a
sudden dart into the room, he seized the skin and thrusting
it into the fire, claimed the maiden as his bride.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />
<br />
TRANSFORMATION IN FOLK-LORE AND FAIRY-TALE</h3>
<p class="center">
(<i>continued</i>)
</p>


<p>A skin-dress that could be put on or taken off to change
a person into an animal, or into a human being again, is
the basic idea of transformation in folk-tales. When the
skin is burnt the animal permanently resumes human
shape, as appears from the last story in the preceding
chapter. Many legends of frog-princes, serpent-husbands,
swan-maidens, tiger-sons, and so forth, fall into this
class. A quaint and typical story of the kind is told
about a mouse-maiden.</p>

<p>A king and queen of a certain city had a daughter who
was invited to become the bride of a prince who lived
in another city. Messengers were sent to fetch her, and
when they arrived at the palace they ordered the bride
to come out of her room to eat the rice of the wedding-feast.
But the queen said to the messengers, "She is
now eating cooked rice in the house."</p>

<p>They then begged the princess to come out to dress in
the robes sent by the bridegroom, but the queen said,
"She is already putting on robes in her chamber." Then
they said she was to come out and be taken to the bridegroom's
city, and the queen, having put a female mouse
in an incense box, asked two of the messengers to come
forward and gave the box into their hands, saying,
"Take this and until seven days have gone by do not
lift the lid of the box."</p>

<p>With this the messengers had to be satisfied. They
took the box to the prince's city, and when they lifted
the lid after seven days the mouse jumped out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
box and hid herself among the cooking pots. Now it
was the duty of a servant girl in the prince's household
to apportion and serve cooked rice and vegetable curry to
the prince, and when he was satisfied, she covered up
the cooking pots containing the rest of the food. Then
the mouse came, and having taken and eaten some of
the cooked rice and vegetables, covered up the cooking
pots and went back to hide among the pots.</p>

<p>The following day the same thing occurred, and the
prince said to the servant, "Does the mouse eat cooked
rice? Look and tell me."</p>

<p>The girl went to see and when she came back she
said, "She has eaten the cooked rice and covered the
cooking pots, and has gone."</p>

<p>Next day the prince said, "I am going to cut the rice-crop.
Remain at home and, when evening comes, put
the utensils for cooking near the hearth." So the servant
obeyed him and in the evening the mouse came and
cooked. She placed the food ready and again ran and
hid behind the pots.</p>

<p>This went on for several days, and when the whole rice-crop
was garnered in, the prince went near to the place
where the mouse was hidden and said, "Having pounded
the rice and removed the husks, let us go to your village
and present it to your parents as first-fruits." But the
mouse said, "I will not go. You go!" So the prince
made the servant get the package of cooked rice ready,
and he went to the village of the queen and gave the
package to her.</p>

<p>And the queen said, "Where is my daughter?" The
prince answered, "She refused to come."</p>

<p>Then the queen said, "Go back to your city, and having
placed the cooking utensils near the hearth, hide yourself
and stay in the house."</p>

<p>After the prince returned to the city, he did as she had
told him. The mouse, having come out, took off her
mouse-jacket, and, assuming the shape of a girl, put on
other clothes. While she was preparing to cook, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
prince took the mouse-jacket and burnt it.</p>

<p>Afterwards when the girl went to the place where the
mouse-jacket had been and looked for it, it was not there.
Then she looked in the hearth, and saw that there was
one sleeve of the skin-dress among the embers. While
she was there weeping and weeping, the prince came out
of his hiding-place and said, "Your mother told me to
burn the mouse-jacket. Now you are really mine!"</p>

<p>So the mouse became a princess again and married the
prince.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The same idea is contained in the story of the king
who, putting on a jackal-skin, turns into a jackal, only
resuming human form permanently when the skin is
burnt.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> In "Indian Fairy Tales" there is a prince who
has a monkey-skin which he can put on and off at pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
A king's daughter in another story also has a
monkey-skin and when a prince burns it she takes fire
and flies away all ablaze to her father's palace.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Four
fairy doves in feather-dresses appear in "Romantic Tales
from the Panjab with Indian Night's Entertainment."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
When they take off their feathers to bathe, a prince
conceals one dress and the fairy is unable to resume bird
form. The story of the feather-vest of the dove-maiden
in "The Arabian Nights"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> is similar in style.</p>

<p>The swan-maidens or cloud-maidens, as they are sometimes
called, have a shirt made of swan's feathers which
acts much in the same manner as the wolf-skin to the
wer-wolf. The swan-maiden retains human shape as
long as she is kept away from her feather tunic. The
commonest form of this legend is that of a man who
passes by a lake and sees several beautiful maidens bathing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
their feather-dresses lying on the bank. He approaches
quietly and steals one of the dresses. In due
course the bathers come to the shore, don their dresses
and swim off in the shape of swans, all but one, who is
left lamenting on the shore. Then the thief appears,
tells her what he has done and bids the maiden marry
him. They live happily together until one day when the
husband, by accident, leaves the wardrobe door unlocked
and the swan-maiden puts on her feather-shirt and flies
off, never to return.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>In a similar story the maiden is wearing a gold chain
round her neck which her huntsman lover seizes, thus
gaining the power over her which makes it possible to
woo and wed her. She gives birth in due course to seven
sons, each one of whom wears a gold chain about his
neck and can transform himself into a swan at will.</p>

<p>Lothaire, King of France, married a fairy wife, and
his children were born wearing golden collars which
gave them the magical power of assuming the form of
swans.</p>

<p>In the legends which have a Knight of the Swan as
hero, like the story of Lohengrin, the swan plays only a
secondary part.</p>

<p>The primitive idea at the root of all these stories is
that the human soul, in passing from one shape to
another, has to wear the outer sign or garment of the
creature it desires to represent. The symbolic difference
between the wer-wolf and the swan-maiden is that the
former represents the rough, howling, and destructive
night-wind, the latter the fleecy, pure, and enthralling
summer cloud.</p>

<p>The Valkyries, with their shirts of plumage, who hover
over Scandinavian battle-fields to minister to the souls
of dying heroes are of the same order of beings as the
Hindu Asparas and the Houris of the Mussulman. The
Lorelei sirens with their fish-tails, their golden combs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and mirrors, who lure fishermen to their doom on the
rocks, are not far removed from the same family. All
are partly human and allied with more or less fanciful
animal forms and characteristics. They are frequently
the precursors of evil or at least of danger to mankind,
but many of them possess a sweetness and charm which
is unsurpassed and unsurpassable.</p>

<p>Far more terrible than sirens and swan-maidens were
the Berserkers of Scandinavia in the ninth century who,
possessed by a strange mania, arrayed themselves in the
skins of wolves or bears and went forth to see whom
they might devour.</p>

<p>The Mara is a more peaceable but nevertheless a more
uncanny being, a kind of female demon who comes at
night to torment sleepers by crouching on their bodies
and checking respiration. Sometimes she is to be seen
in animal form, sometimes as a beautiful woman. She
has been known to torture people to death, and may
perhaps have some distant affinity to the vampire, but
is far less vindictive and self-seeking, though gifted with
powers of darkness.</p>

<p>A pious knight, journeying one day, found a fair lady
nude, and bound to a tree, her back streaming with blood
from the stripes of lashes. Rescuing her from her unfortunate
position, he took her to his palace and made
her his wife, her extraordinary loveliness winning her
fame throughout the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Her husband, the knight, accompanied her to mass
every Sunday, and to his great surprise and regret she
always refused to stay in the church while the creed was
said. Just beforehand she would deliberately rise from
her seat and walk out. Her husband questioned her about
this strange habit, but could get no satisfactory explanation,
nor would she consent to alter her behaviour. He
used entreaties and even threats without avail, and at
last he decided to keep her in the church by main force.
Seizing upon her with both hands, he held her in her
seat, and then he noticed her frame become convulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and her eyes grow unnaturally large and dark. The
service stopped and everyone in the building turned to
see what was happening. "In the name of God, speak,"
cried the pious knight, "and tell me what or who thou
art!" and as he said these words his wife melted away
and disappeared, while, with a great cry of anguish, a
monster of evil shape rose from the spot where she had
been sitting and, passing through the air, vanished through
the roof of the church.</p>

<p>Another legend about the Mara is that if she be
wrapped up in the bedclothes and held down tightly, a
white dove flies out of the window and the bedclothes
will be found to contain nothing. This belief is apparently
isolated and unrelated to other phenomena and is
probably only a tribute to the elusive character of this
she-demon.</p>

<p>One of the Calmuc stories concerns three sisters, who,
coming across an enchanted castle tenanted by a white
bird, are each in turn offered marriage by the owner.
The third sister marries the bird, who turns out to be a
handsome cavalier, but having burned his aviary, she
loses him, and cannot regain her husband until the aviary
is restored.</p>

<p>In the well-known story of "The Brahman Girl who
marries a Tiger," the tiger assumes human shape and
makes a beautiful girl fall in love with him. Soon after
their marriage he threatens her, saying, "Be quiet or I
shall show you my original shape."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> When she urges
him to do so he changes and behold, "four legs, a
striped skin, a long tail, and a tiger's face come on him
suddenly, and, horror of horrors, a tiger, and not a man
stands before her!"</p>

<p>She has to obey all his orders and finally gives birth
to a son, who also turns out "to be only a tiger."</p>

<p>She gets her brothers to help her, murders her child
and runs off home. In the end the tiger is killed by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
relatives, and the Brahman girl, in memory of him, raises
a pillar over the well and plants a fragrant shrub on the
top of it.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The Chinese have a curious idea about "making
animals,"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and a story is told about a man who arrived
at an inn in Yang-Chow leading five donkeys. He asks
the landlord whether he may put the animals in the stable,
and while he goes off for a short time, he leaves instructions
that they are not to be given water to drink. They
become so restless, however, that the landlord takes the
responsibility of setting them loose, and they make a
rush to a neighbouring pond. But no sooner has water
touched their lips than they roll on the ground and
change into women. The landlord, frightened at what
has occurred, hides them in his house and presently the
man returns leading five sheep. But now the landlord's
suspicions are aroused and, persuading his guest to take
wine indoors, he goes out and waters the sheep. They
turn into young men and their temporary owner is put
under arrest and executed for a sorcerer.</p>

<p>In a Basque story, seven brothers forbid their sister to
go near a certain house. She disobeys them and a witch
in the house gives her certain herbs, telling her to put
them in her brothers' foot-bath. She does so and the
brothers are changed into cows. The ideas contained in
these examples are similar in character to those contained
in Grimm's "Household Tales." The following is more
like the Japanese wer-fox episodes:&mdash;</p>

<p>A certain prince royal of India has a lovely mistress
who bewitches him, and who falls asleep one day in a bed
of chrysanthemums where her lover shoots and wounds
a fox in the forehead. The girl is found to be bleeding
from a wound in her temple and is thus exposed. She is
an evil animal.</p>

<p>In many stories women give birth to animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>A widow who lives near a palace and makes a livelihood
by pounding rice, bears a frog which becomes a good-looking
prince, but he ends as a frog.</p>

<p>In the story of Madana Kama Raja (Natesa Sastri) a
queen bears a tortoise prince who has the power of leaving
his shell, and assuming human form. One day his mother
is present at the transformation and smashes the shell,
after which her son has to remain a man. Another queen
gives birth to a tortoise which is reared by her, and goes
in search of divine flowers, which he obtains by the aid
of a nymph.</p>

<p>A raja has two wives and the first has six sons, the
second only one, who is a mongoose. His name is
Lelsing, and he speaks like a man, but grows no bigger
than an ordinary mongoose. In this story the six brothers
do everything they can to ill-treat the mongoose boy,
but all their tricks turn to his advantage, and in the end
he grows rich while they grow poor, and finally they all
get drowned, while he goes home rejoicing at his revenge
upon them for their unkindness.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The Bards at Jaisalmer claimed one of the raja's sons
for a ruler, so he gave them one of his seven ranis, who
was expecting to become a mother, and they took her to
Nahan and near the Sarmor tank she gave birth first to
a lion and four monsters, and then to a son. After the
monsters were exorcised they took the child to Medni
and he became the first raja of Nahan (Sarmor).<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Another raja's child was born with the ears of an ox.
Only the raja's barber knew, but he blurted it out to the
dom and the dom went to the raja's palace and sang</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The son of the raja<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Has the ears of an ox."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the raja was very angry, and only forgave the
dom when he said he had not been told about the misfortune,
but that a drum had sung the words to him.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Two Brothers" is a typical and classical story
in which one brother assumes the form of a great bull
with all the sacred marks. In another story of German
origin, the hero, who has been hacked to pieces and stuffed
in a bag, is restored to life by a master sorcerer, who
endows him with the power of assuming whatever shape
he pleases. He turns into a fine horse, and the king's
daughter, believing she is being deceived, has the animal
decapitated.</p>

<p>A similar Russian tale is about a horse which has a
golden mane and, when it is killed, a bull with golden
hair arises from the blood spilt.</p>

<p>So numerous are the stories of this description, dealing
with transformation, that it is practically impossible to
divide them into their various types, although many
attempts to classify them have been made by authoritative
writers on folk-lore; nor is it possible to give them
due occult significance. They are interesting chiefly
on account of the details which may be gathered from
them concerning methods and reasons of transformation.</p>

<p>The Indian Rakshasa (Bengalese Raqhosh) are beings
of a malevolent nature which haunt cemeteries, harass
the devout, animate dead bodies, and afflict mankind in
various ways. They can assume any form they please,
animal or other. Females appear as beautiful women for
the purpose of luring men to their doom. When in
their natural state they have upstanding hair, yellow as
the flames which they vomit forth from mouths which
are provided with huge tusks. They have large, black,
hairy bodies. The Nagas, on the other hand, are semi-divine
snake-beings with good impulses.</p>

<p>In "Bengali Household Tales," by William McCulloch,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
a Raqhosh performs a transformation in the
following manner: He removes a stone from an underground
passage and descending brings forth a monkey.
He then plucks a few leaves from a tree, draws water
from a well close by, throws the leaves into it and pours
it over the body of the monkey. The monkey is immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
transformed into a beautiful young woman
with whom the Raqhosh descends by the underground
passage. Towards dawn the two come up again. This
time the Raqhosh plucks some leaves from another tree
and throws them into some water from another well,
and then pours it over the young woman. Instantaneously
she is changed into a monkey again.</p>

<p>This is not the most usual way for such transformations
and retransformations to occur in Indian folk-tales;
sometimes they are achieved by magic rods. In Grimm's
"Household Tale," "Donkey Cabbages," one kind of
cabbage transforms a man into an ass and the other
reverses the process.</p>

<p>Magicians, however, have other methods. Mercurius,
the most skilful of sorcerers, was supposed to have discovered
the secret of "fascinating" men's eyes in such
a way as to make people invisible to their sight, or perhaps
to give them the appearance of an animal. This
may be compared to modern hypnotism and has an important
bearing on the subject.</p>

<p>Pomponius Mela attributes to the Druidical priestesses
of Sena the knowledge of transforming themselves into
animals at will.</p>

<p>Proteus, according to Homer's account, becomes a
dragon, a lion, or a boar. Eustathius, the commentator,
adds, "not really changing but only appearing to do
so." Proteus was an adroit worker of miracles, and was
well acquainted with the secrets of Egyptian philosophy.
He assumed animal shape in order to escape the necessity
of foretelling the future when asked to do so but, whenever
he saw his endeavours were of no avail, he resumed
his natural appearance.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century Joseph
Acosta, who resided in Peru, asserts that sorcerers existed
there at that time who were capable of assuming any
form they pleased. He tells of a ruler of a city in Mexico
who was sent for by the predecessor of Montezuma and
who transformed himself successively before the eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
men who tried to seize his person, into a tiger, an eagle,
and a serpent. At length he gave in, and being taken
before the emperor was condemned to death.</p>

<p>The same kind of power was ascribed, in 1702, by the
Bishop of Chiapa (a province of Guatemala) to the
Naguals, the national priests who endeavoured to win
back the children brought up as Christians by the
Government, to the religion of their ancestors. After
various ceremonies, the child he was teaching was told
to advance and embrace the Nagual. At that moment
he assumed a hideous animal form, and as a lion, tiger, or
other wild beast, threw the young convert to Christianity
into a state of abject terror by appearing chained
to him.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> There, no doubt, hypnotism became a weapon
of religious fanaticism.</p>

<p>At the appearance of the monster Ravanas, the gods,
becoming alarmed, transform themselves into animals:
Indras changes into a peacock, Yamas into a crow,
Kuveras into a chameleon, and Varunas into a swan in
order to escape the ire of the enemy.</p>

<p>These transformations, says de Gubernatis,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> instead of
being capricious, were necessary and natural to the several
gods, for the animal is the shadow that follows the hero
and is so closely identified with him that it may often
be said to be the hero himself.</p>

<p>Nash, in "Christ's Tears over Jerusalem," 1613, has
the following remarkable passage. "They talk of an ox
that tolled the bell at Woolwich, and how from an ox
he transformed himself into an old man, and from an
old man to an infant and into a young man again."</p>

<p>The Egyptians were the first to broach the opinion
that the soul of man is immortal and that, when the
body dies, it enters into the form of an animal which is
born at the moment, thence passing on from one animal
to another, until it has circled through the forms of all
the creatures which tenant the earth, the water, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
air, after which it enters again into a human frame and
is born anew. The whole period of transmigration is
(they say) three thousand years.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>According to Egyptian beliefs only the souls of
wicked men suffered the disgrace of entering the body
of an animal when, "weighed in the balance" before
the tribunal of Osiris, they were pronounced unworthy
to enter the abode of the blessed. The soul was then
sent back to the body of a pig.</p>

<p>The doctrine of metempsychosis was borrowed from
Egypt by Pythagoras and classical allusions are so numerous
that it is impossible to mention more than a few
instances.</p>

<p>Empedocles believed he had passed through many
forms, a bird and a fish among others. Lucian's story
was of a Pythagorian cock which had been a man, a
woman, a fish, a horse, and a frog, and of all states he
thought that man was the most deplorably wretched of
the animals. After anointing himself with enchanted
salve from Thessaly, Lucian was transformed into an
ass and worked for seven years under a "gardiner,
a tyle man, a corier, and suchlike." At the end of the
period he was restored to human shape by nibbling rose
leaves.</p>

<p>Dionysius was believed to assume the form of a goat
or of a bull, and Cronius was said to take the form
of a horse. Epona was a horse-goddess, and Callisto
in an Arcadian myth was changed into a bear. Citeus,
son of Lycaon, laments the transformation of his daughter
into a bear. Iphigenia at the moment of sacrifice was
changed into a fawn. Osiris was mangled by a boar, or
Typhon in the form of a boar;&mdash;just as in the tale of
Diarmuid and Grainne, the former's foster brother was
transformed into a boar.</p>

<p>The sorceress Thessala was able to call up strange
animal ghosts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here in all nature's products unfortunate;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Foam of mad dogs, which waters fear and hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Guts of the lynx; Hyæna's knot unbred;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The marrow of a hart with serpents fed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were not wanting; no, nor the sea lamprey<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which stops the ships; nor yet the dragon's eye."<br /></span>
<span class="i39"><span class="smcap">Lucan.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream" Puck
is gifted with the power of transformation. He says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sometimes a horse I'll be, sometimes a hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like horse, hound, dog, bear, fire, at every turn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had also the power to transform others into animals,
and seeing Bottom studying the part of Pyramus, plays a
trick upon him:</p>

<p>"An ass's nole I fixed on his head."</p>

<p>"Bless thee, Bottom," says Quin, seeing his companion
transformed in this manner, "Bless thee! thou art
translated." But Titania, herself under a spell, becomes
enamoured of the vision. "So is mine eye enthralled to
thy shape," she cries, and she desires to stick musk-roses
in his sleek smooth head, and kiss the fair, large ears."
Fortunately Oberon orders Puck to restore Bottom to
his normal shape before much harm is done.</p>

<p>Many modern writers have used the mystic idea of
animal transformation, especially as gleaned from Celtic
legendary sources; for instance, in the tales by Fiona
McLeod and the poems by W. B. Yeats.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Do you not hear me calling white deer with no horns!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I have been changed to a hound with one red ear;"<br /></span>
</div>

<hr class="hr2" />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A man with a hazel wand came without sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And changed me suddenly, while I was looking another way;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now my calling is but the calling of a hound."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In another poem the salmon caught by a young fisherman
is no sooner under his roof, than it changes into a
shimmering maiden&mdash;which makes one think of the
Indian story of a shining man who casts his ugly skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and is so bright that no one can see him without being
blinded.</p>

<p>A pretty little story of a shining lady who becomes a
butterfly, is told by Mr. H. A. Giles in "Strange Stories
from a Chinese Studio."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Mr. Wang of Chang-shang,
the District Magistrate, had a habit of commuting the
fines and penalties of the Penal Code inflicted on prisoners
in exchange for a corresponding number of butterflies.
He rejoiced in seeing the insects flutter hither and
thither like "tinsel snippings" borne on the breeze.
One night he dreamt that a beautiful girl in shimmering
clothes stood before him who said sadly, "Your cruel
practice has brought many of my sisters to an untimely
end; now you must pay the penalty for what you have
done." Then she transformed herself into a butterfly
and flew away.</p>

<p>A great feature in folk-tales and fairy stories is, of
course, the talking animal. Grimm's "Tales," the
"Arabian Nights," and Hans Andersen's "Märchen,"
have made such semi-human creatures thoroughly
familiar. They appear also in the Bible and mythology.
Eve and the serpent, Balaam and the ass, Achilles and
his horses, Porus and the elephant, Bacchus, Phryxius
and many others are notable instances. The idea of
words of wisdom coming from the lips of brutes is brought
to greater perfection in the fables than elsewhere, and
Æsop's animals are gifted with speech, traits, and
passions absolutely human.</p>

<p>Pilpay, Lokman, Babrius, Phædrus, and La Fontaine,
most successfully of all, exploited the same theme, and a
wonderful procession of animals stalks through their
writings, almost every kind of zoological specimen being
represented. There are rats enough to require the
services of many Pied Pipers of Hamelin, lions enough
to stock the equatorial forests, wolves to crowd the
Steppes of Russia, bats and birds, gnats and frogs galore,
and to each beast, feathered thing, or fish, a place is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
given in the social scale which he fills with dignity and
grace, or in which he acts with wisdom and judgment,
or again in which he is made to look ridiculous and
becomes the laughing stock of those about him.</p>

<p>"If one is a wolf, one devours," wrote Walpole,
referring to the fables of La Fontaine. "If one is a fox,
one is cunning. If one is a monkey, one is a coxcomb."</p>

<p>The fox always gets the better of everyone else in the
fables. He makes use of the goat to climb out of the
well, and then leaves him to his fate. He is always taking
the advantage of the wolf, for he has more brains, if less
strength. He has no difficulty in inventing stratagems
which bring the plump turkeys into his larder. He is
always diplomatic, he comes smiling out of every difficulty,
he is quick and energetic: his personal appearance,
heightened by his bright eye and bushy tail, is in
his favour. He has two qualities invaluable to the
courtier, a certain dash and a certain subtlety, and above
all he is <i>bon viveur</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grand Croqueur de poulets, grands preneur de lapins."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His worst enemy is the dog, with whom his tricks are
frequently wanting in success. When out walking with
the cat, and boastful of his own superior resources, he
finds himself at a disadvantage the moment an attack is
threatened by a pack of hounds. The cat quickly
climbs a lofty tree.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fox his hundred ruses tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And yet no safety found:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A hundred times he falsified<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The nose of every hound.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was here, and there, and everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Above and underground."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the end they are too clever for him, and he meets his
death.</p>

<p>The story of Reynard the fox is a novel of adventure
in which animals play the part of men and usually bear
men's names, and who does not know and love the tale
of Brer Rabbit and Brer B'ar and their relations with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Uncle Remus, or the equally human animals of Alice's
"Adventures."</p>

<p>These fictitious beings combine human and animal
mental characteristics, but there is another class, the
fabulous animals, of which the physical attributes are
taken partly from man, partly from animal types. They
are no doubt symbolic of occult truths, and much time
and labour might be spent in formulating their relationship.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<br />
FABULOUS ANIMALS AND MONSTERS</h3>


<p>The most important among fabulous animals which are
partly human beings are the centaur, half-man and half-horse;
the harpy, half-woman and half-vulture; the
sphinx, which has the head of a woman, the body of a
lion and the wings of an eagle, and the satyr, an old man
with goat's legs and tail.</p>

<p>"Gorgons and Hydras, and Chimaeras&mdash;dire stories of
Celaeno and the Harpies," says Charles Lamb, "may
reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition&mdash;but
they were there before. They are transcripts, types&mdash;the
archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else should
the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be
false, come to affect us at all?&mdash;or</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Names whose sense we see not,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fray us with things that be not?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects,
considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon
us bodily injury?&mdash;O, least of all! These terrors are of
older standing. They date beyond body&mdash;or, without
the body, they would have been the same. All the cruel,
tormenting, defined devils in Dante&mdash;tearing, mangling,
choking, stifling, scorching demons&mdash;are they one half
so fearful to the spirit of a man, as the simple idea of a
spirit unembodied following him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like one that on a lonesome road<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Doth walk in fear and dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For having once turn'd round, walks on,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And turns no more his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because he knows a frightful fiend<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Doth close behind him tread.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That the kind of fear here treated of is purely spiritual&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
it is strong in proportion as it is objectless upon
earth&mdash;and that it predominates in the period of sinless
infancy&mdash;are difficulties the solution of which might
afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane
condition, and a peep at least into the shadowland of
pre-existence."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Prentice Mulford firmly believed that the supposed
fables in the ancient mythologies concerning beings half-men,
half-beasts (such as centaurs or mermaids) had
had their origin in spiritual truths. "Our race," he
says, "has been so developed out of the animal or coarser
forms of life. Countless ages ago all forms of life were
coarser than now. As these grew finer, man attracted
and absorbed the spirit of the finer."</p>

<p>"The history of animals such as the ancients have
transmitted to us," says Eusebe Salverte,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> "is filled with
details apparently chimerical: but which are sometimes
only the consequence of a defective nomenclature. The
name, Onocentaur, which seems to designate a monster,
uniting the form of a man and an ass, was given to a
quadrumanus which runs sometimes on four paws, but
at other times uses its forepaws only as hands: merely
an immense monkey covered with grey hair, particularly
on the lower part of the body...."</p>

<p>M. Geoffroy de St. Hillaire described a polydactyle
horse as having hairy fingers separated by membranes:
yet when ancient authors have spoken of horses, the feet
of which bore some resemblance to the hands and feet
of a man, they have been accused of imposture.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The Centaurs were mythical creatures which inhabited
Thessaly. They were said to have sprung from a union
of Ixion and a Cloud, or, according to other authorities,
to be the offspring of Centaurus, son of Apollo, by
Stilbia, daughter of Peneus. The famous battle of the
Centaurs with the Lapithæ was occasioned by a quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
at the marriage of Hippodamia with Pirithous. The
Centaurs having come to a state of intoxication, offered
violence to the women present, an insult for which they
received due punishment.</p>

<p>A vivid presentment of what changing shape from man
to horse would mean is to be found in Mr. Algernon
Blackwood's "The Centaur,"<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> in which story the Irish
hero, Mally, watches his own transformation into the
figure of the <i>Urwelt</i>, with amazement.</p>

<p>"All white and shining lay the sunlight over his own
extended form. Power was in his limbs; he rose above
the ground in some new way; the usual little stream
of breath became a river of rushing air he drew into
stronger, more capacious lungs; likewise his bust grew
strangely deepened, pushed the wind before it; and
the sunshine glowed on shaggy flanks agleam with dew
that powerfully drove the ground behind him while
he ran.</p>

<p>"He ran yet only partly as a man runs; he found himself
shot forwards through the air, upright, yet at the
same time upon all fours ... it was his own feet
now that made that trampling as of hoofs upon the
turf."</p>

<p>In "Gulliver's Travels" the men-horses or Houyhnhnms
are fine horses gifted with human intelligence,
but the Yahoos are described by Swift as having a very
peculiar shape. Their heads and breasts were covered
with a thick hair, some frizzled and others lank, they had
beards like goats and a long ridge of hair down their
backs, and the foreparts of their legs and feet, but the
rest of their bodies was bare, so that their skins, which
were of a brown-buff colour, could be seen. They had
no tails, and they sat on the ground as well as laid down,
and often stood on their hind feet. They climbed high
trees as nimbly as a squirrel, for they had strong extended
claws before and behind, terminating in sharp points and
hooked. They would often spring and bound and leap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
with prodigious agility.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>In speaking, the Houyhnhnms pronounced through
the nose and throat, and their language approached
nearest to High-Dutch or German, but was more graceful
and significant.</p>

<p>Swift no doubt took his idea of the men-horses from
centaurs.</p>

<p>The Harpies were three fabulous winged monsters,
offsprings of Neptune and Terra, represented with the
features of a woman, the body of a vulture, and human
fingers armed with sharp claws. Heraldically the harpy
appears as a vulture with the head and breasts of a woman.
Neptune's daughters emitted an odious stench and
polluted all they touched.</p>

<p>The Sphinx was another composite fabled monster,
with the head and breasts of a woman, the body of a
dog, the tail of a serpent, the wings of a bird, the paws
of a lion, and a human voice. According to the Grecian
poets the animal infested the city of Thebes, devouring
the inhabitants and setting difficult riddles. It was
promised, however, that on the solution of one of its
enigmas the Sphinx would destroy itself. The puzzle
to be solved was, "What animal walked on four legs in
the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?"
Many people attempted to find a solution in the hope of
winning Jocasta, sister of Creon, King of Thebes, in
marriage, but all fell victims to their ambition until the
advent of &#338;dipus, who answered the Sphinx, saying, Man
crept on his hands and feet in infancy, at noon he walked
erect, and in the evening of life required the support of
a staff. On hearing the reply the Sphinx dashed her head
against a rock and expired. In Egypt sphinxes with
human heads were called Androsphinxes. They had no
wings, which were added by the Greek artists.</p>

<p>Hecate, the Greek goddess, was described as having
three bodies or three heads, one of a horse, the second of
a dog, and the third of a lion. She was a spectral being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
who at night sent from the lower world all kinds of
demons and phantoms to teach sorcery. She wandered
about with the souls of the dead and her approach was
announced by the whining and howling of dogs.</p>

<p>Hathor was pictured sometimes as a cow, sometimes
as a woman with the head of a cow, bearing the solar
disc between her horns.</p>

<p>Other animal goddesses of curious shapes are Egyptian,
such as the cat-goddess, the bird-goddess, the hippopotamus-goddess,
Smet-Smet or Rert-Rert, figures of
which may be seen at the British Museum.</p>

<p>Strange creatures too were the Gorgons, the three
sisters, Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa, daughters of
Phorcys and Ceto. Their hairs were entwined with
serpents, they had hands of brass, scales on their body,
and the tusks of a wild boar. Their frightful appearance
caused those who beheld them to turn to stone. They
were conquered by Perseus, who was given special
weapons for the purpose by the gods. He cut off Medusa's
head and gave it to Minerva; as he fled through the air
to Ethiopia drops of blood fell to the ground from the
severed head and turned to serpents. Pegasus, the winged
horse, sprang from Medusa's blood and became the
favourite of the Muses. He was given to Bellerophon
and helped him to conquer the Chimaera, the celebrated
monster with three heads, a lion's, goat's, and dragon's,
which continually sent forth flames. The forepart of
its body was that of a lion, the middle of a goat, and the
hind part that of a dragon.</p>

<p>These are the chief mythological monsters, thus rapidly
enumerated, but other creatures, half-human, half-animal,
are of greater interest psychologically. For instance, the
Persians believe firmly in ghouls which wander in lonely
and haunted places, lure travellers from their path and
devour them. They are hideous in shape and give forth
blood-curdling screams. Being able to assume any
animal form at will, they often appear as camels or
mules, or perhaps even simulate a human being well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
to their intended victim. The charm against
them is to utter the name of the Prophet in all sincerity.</p>

<p>The Persians also believe in <i>divs</i> or cat-headed men
with horns and hoofs. <i>Jinns</i> or <i>Afreets</i> can turn themselves
into animals at will and so no Persian likes to kill
dogs or cats, lest the angry demons, whose dwelling-place
they are, should haunt those responsible for evicting them.</p>

<p>The Satyrs were rural demi-gods, in the shape of men
but with legs and feet like goats, short horns on the head
and the body covered with hair. They attended on
Bacchus and were given to similar excesses. They roamed
through woods, dwelt in caves, and endeavoured to gain
the loves of the Nymphs. They were identical with
Fauns, Panes or Sylvani, the human-goat wood-spirits.
They should not be confused with the Nature-Spirits
described by Paracelsus, though similar in name.</p>

<p>In Russia wood-spirits are believed to appear partly
in human shape, but also with horns, ears, and legs of
goats. They are called Ljeschi and can change their
shape and size, in a forest, being large like trees; in a
meadow, merely the height of the grass.</p>

<p>The Griffin was half-lion and half-eagle, and apparently
had no human characteristics.</p>

<p>The Mermaid is a fabulous marine creature, partly
woman and partly fish. The Nereides were sea-nymphs,
daughters of Nereus, the ancient sea-god and his wife
Doris. They were at least fifty in number (Propertius
says a hundred), and they had green hair and fishes'
tails. The most celebrated of them all were Amphitrite,
wife of Neptune, Thetis, mother of Achilles, Galatea,
and Doto. They are identical with the Sirens.</p>

<p>Many charming stories have been told of Mermaids,
and Mermaid-prophetesses.</p>

<p>According to the old Danish ballad a mermaid foretold
the death of Queen Dagmar, wife of Valdemar II,
surnamed the Victorious.</p>

<p>"In the year 1576," says the Chronicle of Frederick II
of Denmark, "there came late in the autumn a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
old peasant from Samso to the Court then being held at
Kalundborg, who related that a beautiful female had
more than once come to him while working in his field
by the seashore, whose figure, from the waist downwards,
resembled that of a fish, and who had solemnly and
strictly enjoined him to go over and announce to the
king, that as God had blessed his queen so that she was
pregnant of a son (afterwards Christian IV), who should
be numbered among the greatest princes of the North,
and, seeing that all sorts of sins were gaining ground in
his kingdom, he, in honour of and in gratitude to God
who had so blessed him, should wholly extirpate such
sins, lest God should visit him with anger and punishment
thereafter."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In the Shetland Isles mermaids are said to dwell among
the fishes, in the depths of the ocean, in mansions of
pearl and coral. They resemble human beings, but
greatly excel them in beauty. When they wish to visit
the earth they put on the <i>ham</i> or garb of some fish, but
if they lose this garment, all hopes of return are annihilated
and they must stay where they are.</p>

<p>A mermaid was found by a fisherman called Pergrin
at St. Dognael's, near Cardigan, and he took her prisoner,
but she wept bitterly and said to him, "If you will let
me go, Pergrin, I will call to you three times at the
moment of your greatest need." Moved by her distress,
he obeyed and almost forgot the incident, but some weeks
later he was fishing on a hot, calm day, when he heard
distinctly, the call, thrice repeated, "Pergrin, take up
thy nets." This he did in great haste, and by the time
he reached the harbour a terrible storm had come up,
and all the other fishermen who had not been warned
were drowned. This story, it is claimed, belongs to
other parts of Wales also.</p>

<p>There is said to be a castle in Finland, on the borders
of a small lake, out of which, previously to the death of
the Governor, an apparition in the form of a mermaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
arises and makes sweet melody.</p>

<p>One of the most charming descriptions of a Sea-maiden
is found in Hans Andersen's well-known story of
"The Little Mermaid." Her skin is as soft and delicate
as a rose-leaf, her eyes are as deep a blue as the sea, but
like all other mermaids, she has no feet; her body ends
in a tail like that of a fish. For many years she plays
happily in the enchanted palace of the Mer-king, her
father, but when she reaches years of discretion she visits
the earth and falls in love with a handsome prince, forsaking
her home and family and giving away her beautiful
voice for love of him. But she does more even than
this, for she has to appeal to a witch to transform her
into a maiden like the others who walk on land, and the
process is a terribly painful one. The witch prepares a
drink she has to take with her on her journey to the
unknown country, and she is told that she must sit
down on the shore and swallow the draught, and that then
her tail will fall and shrink up "to the things which men
call legs." When she walks or dances the pain will be as
though she were walking on the sharp edge of swords or
the edges of ploughshares. But she braves all these terrors
and dances more gracefully than ever any earth-maiden
could do, hoping that her prince will marry her and so
give her the right to an immortal soul. Then the real
tragedy occurs, for the prince loves her only as a beautiful
child, and he marries a princess of his own kind, so that
the mermaid's sacrifice seems to be thrown away. If
she wishes to return to her original state she has to kill
the prince, but when she holds the knife over him as
he sleeps beside his beautiful bride she cannot find it in
her heart to harm him, and sooner than think of her own
forlorn condition, she throws the knife into the sea and
gives up, as she believes, her last hope of happiness.
But then her reward comes, for she is borne into the air
by the daughters of that element, and the story ends
with a promise of a new and a lovelier existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. H. G. Wells, among recent writers, has used the
idea of the mermaid in his quaint story "The Sea Lady."</p>

<p>The famous mermaid figures in the coat-of-arms of
several well-known families. Sometimes she holds a
mirror, sometimes a mirror and comb. A red mermaid
with yellow hair on a white field appears in the arms of
the family living at Glasfryn in the south of Carnarvonshire.</p>

<p>Other marine monsters besides mermaids are sometimes
found in the sea, which, without corresponding
exactly to man, yet resemble him more than any other
animals. However, like the rest of the brutes, they lack
mind or soul. They have, says Paracelsus, the same
relations to man as the ape and are nothing but the apes
of the sea.</p>

<p>Merovingian princes traced their origin to a sea-monster,
and Druid priestesses claimed to be able to
assume animal form and to rule wind and wave. Indeed,
since men first sought to classify other living organisms,
they have credited nature with producing strange and
weird monsters, half-human, half-animal, which exist
either in their own imaginations or in realms beyond the
material plane of everyday cognisance.</p>

<p>In the third Calmuc tale, a man who possesses but one
cow unites himself to her in order that she may become
fruitful, and a tailed monster is born having a man's
body and a bull's head. This man-bull, who is Minotaur,
goes into the forest and picks up three companions, one
black, one green, one white, who accompany him. He
overcomes the enchantments of a dwarf witch, and when
lowered into a well by his companions, he manages to
escape. Presently he meets a beautiful maiden drawing
water, at whose every footstep a flower springs, and
following her, finds himself in heaven.</p>

<p>The classical Minotaurus is said to have been the offspring
of Pasiphae and a bull sent from the sea to Minos,
who shut the half-human monster in the Cnossian
labyrinth and fed him with the bodies of the youths and
maidens sent by the Athenians as a tribute. This monster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
was slain by Theseus.</p>

<p>Among modern writers, Mr. H. G. Wells has perhaps
been the most daring in describing monsters. In "The
Island of Dr. Moreau," Dr. Moreau explains to Pendrick
his method of making humanised animals. "These creatures
you have seen are animals carven and wrought into
new shapes," he says. "To that&mdash;to the study of plasticity
of living forms&mdash;my life has been devoted. I have
studied for years, gaining knowledge as I go. I see you
look horrified, yet I am telling you nothing new. It all
lay in the surface of practical anatomy years ago, but no
one had the temerity to touch it. It's not simply the
outward form of an animal I can change. The physiology,
the chemical rhythm of the creature, may also be
made to undergo an enduring modification, of which
vaccination and other methods of inoculation with
living or dead matter are examples that will, no doubt,
be familiar to you. A similar operation is the transfusion
of blood, with which subject indeed I began. These are
all familiar cases. Less so, and probably far more
extensive, were the operations of those mediæval practitioners
who made dwarfs and beggar cripples and show-monsters;
some vestiges of whose art still remains in
the preliminary manipulation of the young mountebank
or contortionist. Victor Hugo gives an account of them
in <i>L'Homme qui Rit</i> ... but perhaps my meaning
grows plain now. You begin to see that it is a possible
thing to transplant tissue from one part of an animal to
another, or from one animal to another, to alter its
chemical reactions and methods of growth, to modify
the articulations of its limbs, and indeed to change it
in its most intimate structure?..."</p>

<p>"So for twenty years altogether&mdash;counting nine years
in England&mdash;I have been going on, and there is still
something in everything I do that defeats me, makes me
dissatisfied, challenges me to further effort. Sometimes
I rise above my level, sometimes I fall below it, but
always I fall short of the things I dream. The human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
shape I can get now almost with ease, so that it is lithe
and graceful, or thick and strong; but often there is
trouble with the hands and claws&mdash;painful things that I
dare not shape too freely. But it is in the subtle grafting
and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that my
trouble lies. The intelligence is often oddly low, with
unaccountable blank ends, unexpected gaps. And least
satisfactory of all is something that I cannot touch,
somewhere&mdash;I cannot determine where&mdash;in the seat of
the emotions. Cravings, instincts, desires that harm
humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst suddenly
and inundate the whole being of the creature with anger,
hate, or fear. These creatures of mine seemed strange
and uncanny to you as soon as you began to observe
them, but to me, just after I make them, they seem to
be indisputably human beings. It's afterwards, as I
observe them, that the persuasion fades. First one
animal trait, then another, creeps to the surface and
stares at me.... But I will conquer yet. Each time
I dip a living creature into the bath of burning pain, I
say, this time I will burn out all the animal, this time I
will make a rational creature of my own. After all, what
is ten years? Man has been a hundred thousand in the
making."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>"There were swine-men and swine-women," says
Pendrick later, describing the beast-folk, "a mare
rhinoceros creature, and several other females I did not
ascertain. There were several Wolf creatures, a Bear-bull,
and a Saint Bernard Dog Man. I have already
described the Ape Man, and there was a particularly
hateful (and evil-smelling) old woman made of Vixen and
Bear, whom I hated from the beginning."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>"First to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal, for
all that he cast a shadow, and tossed the dust with his
hoofs: after him, from the brake, came a monstrous
lout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros, chewing a straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
as it came: and then appeared the Swine Woman and
two Wolf Women: then the Fox-Bear-Witch, with her
red eyes in her peaked red face, and then others all hurrying
eagerly."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>In another imaginative work dealing with the twenty-ninth
century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, the brute creation has been humanised
in a way never before dreamt of.</p>

<p>"... a levy of 40,000 naturalists were engaged for
years in forming a hundred different zoological armies.
Each of these was, by an admirable system of drill,
brought to such a high state of discipline that a brigade,
consisting of a thousand elephants, a thousand rhinoceroses,
180,000 monkeys and 15,000 other beasts of draught and
burden could be officered with perfect ease by as few as
one thousand naturalists. Birds of burden and fish of
burden were in like manner drafted into the ranks of
the zoological army, and, being subjected to similar
training, were brought to a similar degree of efficiency."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Giraldus Cambrensis wrote of many curious monsters
and strange things that happened in connection with
them. He believed that occult powers came through
them in some manner, and told the story of a Welshman
called Melerius, who had an odd experience by which he
acquired the powers of a seer. One Palm Sunday he
met a damsel whom he had long loved and embraced
her in the woods, when suddenly, instead of a beautiful
girl, he found in his arms a hairy, rough, and hideous
creature, the sight of which deprived him of his senses.
On his return to sanity, many years later, he discovered
that he had wonderful occult gifts of prophecy.</p>

<p>Giraldus also believed that people in Ireland, by
magical arts, could turn "any substance about them
into fat pigs," as they appeared to be, though the colour
was always red, and could then sell them in the markets.
They disappeared, however, "as soon as they crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
any water," and even if they were looked after carefully
they never lasted as pigs for more than three days. He
writes of a man-monster whose body was human, except
the extremities, which were cloven like those of an ox.
This monster had large round eyes like an ox and the only
sound he could make was like an ox lowing. He was present
at the Court of Maurice Fitzgerald in Wicklow, and
took up his food between the fissures of his cloven forefeet.
His fate was to be put secretly to death, a fate
which might with advantage be shared, metaphorically
speaking, by many of the hybrid creatures, or manufactured
monstrosities, figments of unwholesome brains.</p>

<p>Augustine, in the sixteenth book of his "De Civitate
Dei," chapter viii., speaks of monsters of the human
race, born in the East, some having heads of dogs, others
without heads, and eyes in their breasts. "I myself," he
adds, "at the time I was in Italy, heard it said of some
district in those parts, that there the stable women who
had learnt magical arts, used to give something to
travellers in their cheese which transformed them into
beasts of burden, and after they had performed the tasks
required of them, they were allowed to resume their
natural form."</p>

<p>One of the most fearsome among the fabulous animals
is the dragon, an enormous serpent of abnormal form
which is represented in ancient legends as a huge Hydra,
watching as sentinel the Garden of the Hesperides. In
art the dragon is the symbol of sin, and in the Bible
this monster appears as the symbol of the King of Egypt
and the King of Babylon. The dragon, which is the emblem
of the Chinese Empire, like the legendary serpent,
can assume human shape.</p>

<p>The basilisk is another fabulous animal of the snake
tribe, which carries a jewel in its head, and in many
French legends possesses human proclivities. It is the
king of all the serpents and holds itself erect. Its eyes
are red and fiery, the face pointed, and upon its head it
wears a crest like a crown. It has, moreover, the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
gift of killing people by the glare of its eye and other
serpents are said to fly from its presence in dread.</p>

<p>The cockatrice is identical with the basilisk, but is
perhaps not quite so human. It is produced from a
"cock's egg hatched by a frog."</p>

<p>Lilith is the "night-monster," and according to the
Rabbinical idea, she is a spectre in the figure of a woman
who, entering houses in the dead of night, seizes upon the
little children of the household and bears them away to
murder them. According to some accounts she is not
unlike Lamia, and has the form of a serpent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<br />
HUMAN SERPENTS</h3>


<p>Since the beginning of the world the serpent has been
regarded as the most mystic of reptiles. He was called
"more subtil than any beast of the field," from the day
on which he spoke to Eve and said that if she ate of the
fruit of the Tree of Life, her eyes should be opened and
she should surely not die, and he has been endowed with
human powers again and again, worshipped as a god in
every part of the world and depicted in ancient art as
possessed of human form and attributes. In Aztec
paintings the mother of the human race is always represented
in conversation with a serpent who is erect. This
is the serpent, "who once spoke with a human voice."</p>

<p>Mythology has numberless legends which tell of
human or semi-human serpents. The ancient kings of
Thebes and Delphi claimed kingship with the snake,
and Cadmus and his wife Harmonia, quitting Thebes,
went to reign over a tribe of Eel-men in Illyria and became
transformed into snakes, just as now Kaffir kings
are said to turn into boa-constrictors or other deadly
serpents, and some other African tribes believe that
their dead chiefs become crocodiles.</p>

<p>Cecrops, the first king of Athens, was supposed to
have been half-serpent and half-man, and Cychreus,
after slaying a snake which ravaged the island of Salamis,
appeared in the form of his victim.</p>

<p>When Minerva contended with Neptune for the city
of Athens, she created the olive which became sacred to
her, and she planted it on the Acropolis and placed it in
the charge of the serpent-god, Erechthonios, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
represented as half-serpent, half-man, the lower extremities
being serpentine.</p>

<p>The story of Alexander's birth, as told by Plutarch, is
one of the most curious of the man-serpent traditions.
Olympias, his mother, kept tame snakes in the house and
one of them was said to have been found in her bed,
and was thought to be the real father of Alexander the
Great. Lucian adopts this view of Alexander's parentage.</p>

<p>The worship of serpent-gods is found amongst many
nations. The Chinese god Foki, for instance, is said to
have had the form of a man, terminating in the tail of a
snake. The same belief in serpent-gods exists among
the primitive Turanian tribes. The Accadians made the
serpent one of the principal attributes, and one of the
forms of Hea, and we find a very important allusion to a
mythological serpent in the words from an Accadian
dithyrambus uttered by a god, perhaps by Hea:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like the enormous serpent with seven heads, the weapon with seven heads I hold it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the serpent which beats the waves of the sea attacking the enemy in front,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devastator in the shock of battle, extending his power over heaven and earth, the weapon with (seven) heads (I hold it).<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The story of Crishna is very similar to that of Hercules
in Grecian mythology, the serpent forming a prominent
feature in both. Crishna conquers a dragon, into which
the Assoor Aghe had transformed himself to swallow him
up. He defeats also Kalli Naga (the black or evil spirit
with a thousand heads) who, placing himself in the bed
of the river Jumna, poisoned the stream, so that all the
companions of Crishna and his cattle, who tasted of it,
perished. He overcame Kalli Naga, without arms, and
in the form of a child. The serpent twisted himself
about the body of Crishna, but the god tore off his heads,
one after the other, and trampled them under his feet.
Before he had completely destroyed Kalli Naga, the wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and children of the monster (serpents also) came and
besought him to release their relative. Crishna took pity
on them, and releasing Kalli Naga, said to him, "Begone
quickly into the abyss: this place is not proper for thee
since I have engaged with thee, thy name shall remain
through all the period of time and devatars and men
shall henceforth remember thee without dismay." So
the serpent with his wife and children went into the
abyss, and the water which had been affected by his
poison became pure and wholesome.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Crishna also destroyed the serpent-king of Egypt and
his army of snakes.</p>

<p>Lamia was an evil spirit having the semblance of a
serpent, with the head, or at least the mouth, of a
beautiful woman, whose whole figure the demon assumed
for the purpose of securing the love of some man whom,
it was supposed, she desired to tear to pieces and devour.
Lycius is said to have fallen in love with one of these
spirits, but was delivered by his master, Apollonius, who,
"by some probable conjectures," found her out to be a
serpent, a <i>lamia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Keats made use of this idea in his poem, "Lamia."
Later the word was used to mean a witch or enchantress.
Melusina was another beautiful serpent-woman who disappeared
from her husband's presence every Saturday,
and turned into a human fish or serpent.</p>

<p>A modern version of the legend of Melusina is found
in Wales. To assume the shape of a snake, witches prepared
special charms, and sometimes a ban was placed
upon enemies by which they turned into snakes for
a time.</p>

<p>A young farmer in Anglesea went to South Wales and
there he met a handsome girl whose eyes were "sometimes
blue, sometimes grey, and sometimes like emeralds,"
but they always sparkled and glittered. He fell in love
with her at first sight, and she agreed to become his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
if he would allow her to disappear twice a year for a
fortnight without questioning her as to where she went.
To this arrangement the young husband agreed.</p>

<p>For some years he did not trouble himself about his
wife's absence, but his mother began nagging at him,
saying that he ought to find out where she went and what
she did. Taking his mother's advice, he disguised himself
and followed his wife to a lonely part of a forest not
far from their home. Hiding himself behind a huge
rock, he noticed from this point of vantage that his wife
took off her girdle and threw it down in the deep grass
near a dark pool. Then she vanished, and the next
moment he saw a large and handsome snake glide through
the grass, just where she had been standing. He chased
the reptile, but the snake disappeared into a hole near
the pool. The husband went home and waited patiently
for his wife's return, and when she came, he requested
her to tell him where she had been. This she refused to
do, and when he asked her what she did with her girdle,
she blushed painfully.</p>

<p>The next time when she was intending to go away, he
seized and hid the girdle, and thus deferred her departure.
She was taken ill, and he, hoping to rid her of a
baneful charm, threw the girdle in the fire. Then his
wife writhed in agony, and when the girdle was burnt up
she died. The neighbours called her the Snake-Woman
of the South on account of this strange story of her
doings.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>A shoemaker in the Vale of Taff married a widow for
her money and, as love seemed lacking on both sides,
it was not long before serious quarrels occurred between
the couple. Although it was said that hard blows were
struck on both sides, the neighbours remarked that it
was strange the shoemaker's wife appeared amongst them
without a trace of a bruise on her person. At night loud
cries and deep groans arose from the shoemaker's dwelling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and a certain gentleman of an inquisitive turn of
mind decided to discover what took place and hid himself
in a loft over the kitchen, to spy on the couple. Whatever
he may have learnt during the proceedings, he said
nothing, and a report was spread that he had been "paid
to hold his tongue and not divulge the family secret."
At last, however, his discretion failed him, and anger
against the shoemaker, with whom he fell into a dispute,
made him reveal what he knew. He said that as soon as
angry words passed between husband and wife, the latter
"assumed from the shoulders upwards, the shape of a
snake, and deliberately and maliciously sucked her partner's
blood and pierced him with her venomous fangs."</p>

<p>No marks were found on the husband's body, but he
grew ever thinner and weaker, and after ailing for many
months he died. The doctor who tended him in his last
illness declared that he had died from the poisonous sting
of a serpent. After this verdict the spy was given the
credit of his story, which, however, had a gruesome
sequel. He and the doctor were found lying helpless in
the churchyard one morning. When roused from what
seemed a fatal slumber, they said they had been invited
by the shoemaker's widow to drink with her in memory
of her late dear second husband. Then she sprang upon
them in the shape of a snake and stung them severely.
They had only strength enough left to crawl to the churchyard,
where they would probably have died from torpor
had not the neighbours roused them. The widow was
never seen again, but a snake constantly appeared in the
neighbourhood and could not be killed by any means,
so that it earned the name of "the old snake-woman."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was interested in the
subject of prenatal influences, depicted the heroine of
his well-known novel, "Elsie Venner," as a girl who had
received the taint of a serpent before birth, from a snakebite
suffered by her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsie's friend, Helen Darley, knew the secret of the
fascination which looked out of the cold, glittering eyes.
She knew the significance of the strange repulsion which
she felt in her own intimate consciousness underlying the
inexplicable attraction which drew her towards the young
girl in spite of her repugnance.</p>

<p>When Elsie was taken ill her doctor said that she had
lived a double being, as it were, the consequence of the
blight which fell upon her in the dim period before
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Elsie Venner" is an American story, but India, where
the snake is even more familiar, is the home of many
human-serpent stories, and legends of serpent descent.</p>

<p>Near Jait in the Mathura district is a tank with the
broken statue of a hooded serpent on it. Once upon a
time a Raja married a princess from a distant country
and, after a short stay there, decided to take his wife
home, but she refused to go until he had declared his
lineage. The Raja told her she would regret her curiosity,
but she persisted. Finally he took her to the river and
there warned her again. She would not take heed and he
entreated her not to be alarmed at whatever she saw,
adding that if she did she would lose him. Saying this,
he began slowly to descend into the water, all the time
trying to dissuade her from her purpose, till it became
too late and the water rose to his neck. Then, after a
last attempt to induce her to give up her curiosity, he
dived and reappeared in the form of a Naga (serpent).
Raising his hood over the water he said, "This is my
lineage! I am a Nagbansi."</p>

<p>His wife could not suppress an exclamation of grief,
on which the Naga was turned into stone, where he lies
to this day.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>A member of the family of Buddha fell in love with
the daughter of a serpent-king. He was married to her
and presently became the sovereign of the country. His
wife had obtained possession of a human body, but a
nine-headed snake occasionally appeared at the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
her neck. While she slept one night her husband chopped
the serpent in two at a single blow, and this caused her
to become blind.</p>

<p>Another curious legend is told of a Buddha priest
who had become a serpent because he had killed the
tree Elapatra, and he then resided in a beautiful lake near
Taxila. In the days of Hiuen-Tsiang, when the people
of the country wanted fine weather or rain they went to
the spring accompanied by a priest, and, "snapping their
fingers, invoked the serpent," and immediately obtained
their wishes.</p>

<p>The snake tribe is common enough in the Punjaub.
Snake families go through many ceremonies, saying that
in olden days the serpent was a great king. If they find
a dead snake they put clothes on it and give it a regular
funeral. The snake changes its form every hundred
years, when it becomes either a man or a bull. Snake-charmers
have the power of recognising these transformed
snakes, and follow them stealthily until they return to
their holes and then ask them where treasure is hidden.
This they will do on consideration of a drop of blood
from the little finger of a first-born son.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Among fairy tales the favourite story is that of a
human being who dons a snake-skin, and when it is burnt
he resumes human form. The snake-bridegroom is an
exceedingly popular version of this idea.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>There was once a poor woman, who had never borne a
child and she prayed to God that she might be blessed
with one, even though she were to bring forth a snake.
And God heard her prayer, and in due course she gave
birth to a snake. Directly the reptile saw the light of
day it slipped down from her lap into the grass and disappeared.
Now the poor woman mourned constantly
for the snake, because after God had heard and granted
her prayer, it grieved her that the being whom she
had conceived should have vanished without leaving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
trace as to its whereabouts. Twenty years passed, and
then the snake returned and said to its mother, "I am
the serpent to which you gave birth, and which fled
from you into the grass, and I have come back, mother,
so that you may demand the king's daughter for me in
marriage."</p>

<p>At first the mother rejoiced at the sight of her son,
but soon she grew mournful because she did not know
how she dare to demand the hand of the king's daughter
for a serpent, especially as she was very poor. But the
serpent said, "Go along, mother, and do what I ask;
even if the king won't give his daughter, he can't cut
your head off for the mere asking. But whatever he says
to you do not look back until you get home again."</p>

<p>The mother allowed herself to be persuaded and went
to the king. At first the servants would not let her into
the palace, but she went on asking until they admitted
her. When she entered the king's presence she said to
him, "Most gracious Majesty, there is your sword and
here is my head. Strike if you must, but let me tell you
first that for a long time I was childless and then I prayed
to God to bless me, even though I were to bring forth a
serpent, and He blessed me and I brought forth a serpent.
As soon as it saw the light it vanished into the grass and
after twenty years it has returned to me and has sent me
here to ask for the hand of your daughter in marriage."</p>

<p>The king burst into laughter and said, "I will give
my daughter to your son if he builds me a bridge of
pearls and precious stones from my palace to his house."</p>

<p>Then the mother turned to go home, and never looked
back, and when she left the palace a bridge of pearls and
diamonds arose all the way behind her till she reached
her own house. When the mother told the serpent what
the king had said, the serpent remarked to her, "Go again
and see whether the king will give me his daughter, but
whatever he answers don't look round as you come back."</p>

<p>This time the king told the mother that if her son
could give his daughter a better palace than his own, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
should have her for a wife. The mother went back
without looking behind her, and found that her house
had changed into a palace, and everything in it was three
times as good as in the king's palace. All the furniture
was made of pure gold.</p>

<p>Then the serpent asked his mother to go back to the
palace and fetch the king's daughter, and this time the
king told the princess she must marry the serpent. There
was a splendid wedding, and in due course the young wife
found she was to become a mother. Then her friends
grew inquisitive, saying, "If you are living with a serpent
how can you hope to have a child?" At first she
would not answer, but when her mother-in-law insisted
on putting the same question, she replied, "Mother,
your son is not really a serpent, but a young man, so
handsome that there is none other like him. Every
evening he strips off his snake-skin and in the morning
he enters it again."</p>

<p>When the serpent's mother heard this she rejoiced
greatly, and longed to see her son after he had stripped
off his snake-skin.</p>

<p>Presently the two conspirators arranged that when the
young man had gone to bed, they should burn the discarded
skin, and while his mother put it in the oven, his
wife was to pour cold water on her husband lest he should
be destroyed by the heat. No sooner had he laid himself
down to sleep, than they carried out their plan, but
the smell of the burning skin made him cry out, "What
have you done? May God punish you. Where can I
go in the condition I now am?" But the women comforted
him and said it was better for him to live among
ordinary mortals than in the snake form, and before long
the king resigned his throne in his favour, and all turned
out happily.</p>

<p>A very similar story is told of a queen who also gives
birth to a serpent.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> She is allowed to nurse and fondle
her offspring in the usual fashion, but for twenty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
years it does not speak and its first utterance is to demand
from its parents a wife.</p>

<p>When the parents remark that no nice girl would care
to marry a serpent, he tells them not to look in too high
a class for a mate.</p>

<p>In this case the father does the wooing, but the mother
evokes the truth about her son. When she learns about
the snake-skin, she makes the young wife help to burn it,
and tragedy results. The husband curses his wife, saying
that she will not see him again until she has worn through
iron shoes, and that she shall not give birth to her child
until he embraces her once more by putting his right
arm round her. Then he vanishes for three years, and
all that time she is unable to bear her child, so she
decides to seek her husband. She travels through the
world and comes to the house of the Sun's mother, and
when the Sun comes indoors she inquires whether he has
seen her husband. But the Sun can do nothing for her
but to send her to the Moon. The same disappointment
awaits her there, and the Moon sends her to the Winds.
After many striking adventures she finds her husband,
makes him undo his curse, and gives birth to a son who
has golden locks and golden hands.</p>

<p>In another story of serpent-marriage a woman stands
in doubt because she cannot cross a river. A serpent
comes out of the river and says, "What will you give
me if I carry you across?" The woman, having no
other possessions, promises to give her coming child;
if it is a girl as a wife, if a boy as a "name friend." In
after years she has to fulfil her promise and, taking her
daughter to the bank of the river, she sees the snake
draw her beneath the water. In the course of time the
girl bears her husband four snake sons.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>An Ainu girl gave birth to a snake as the result of the
sun's rays shining on her while she slept, and the snake
turned into a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dyaks and Silakans will not kill the cobra because
in remote ages a female ancestor brought forth twins, a
boy and a cobra. The cobra went to the forest, but told
the mother to warn her children that if they were ever
bitten by cobras they must stay in the same place for a
whole day and that then the venom would take no effect.
The boy then met his cobra brother in the jungle one
day and cut off his tail, so that now all cobras have a
blunted tail.</p>

<p>In folk-tales the serpent frequently mates with a
woman. A curious Basuto story concerns a girl called
Senkepeng, who was deserted by her friends and taken
home by an old woman, who said she would make a nice
wife for her son. Her son turned out to be a serpent,
whom no one had ever seen outside his hut, but he had
married all the girls of the tribe in succession with fatal
results to them, because he ate all the food. Every
morning the girl was awakened by a blow of the serpent's
tail and was then ordered to go and prepare his food.
At last she grew tired of this treatment and resolved to
run away. Her serpent-husband pursued her, but she
sang a charm or incantation and this delayed his progress
and gave her a chance of continuing her flight. Whenever
the serpent came up to her she repeated her song.</p>

<p>At last she reached her father's village and told her
story, and people were ready to defend her against her
pursuer. As soon as the serpent came in sight Senkepeng
sang her charm, and the people attacked the serpent and
slew it. Presently the serpent's mother arrived and burnt
the mutilated corpse, wrapping the ashes in a skin which
she threw into a pond. Walking three times round the
pond, without speaking a word, she caused her son to
come to life again, and he came out of the pond as a
human being, and Senkepeng welcomed him as her
husband. In another variant the serpent's ashes are
put in a vase of clay, which is given to Senkepeng. Afterwards
she uncovers the vase and a man steps out from it.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Dindje Indian had two wives, one of whom
would have nothing to say to him. She used to disappear
during the day, and he followed her to find out her
secret. He saw her go into a marsh where she met a
serpent. When she returned to the hut she had several
children, but hid them from her husband under a cover.
The man discovered the hiding-place, and there found
horrible little men-serpents, which he killed. Thereupon
the woman left him and he never saw her again.</p>

<p>In a Bengal story a mighty serpent, after slaughtering
a whole family except one beautiful daughter, carries
her off to his watery tank, from which she is rescued by
a prince. In Russia it is believed that mortal maidens
are carried off by serpents.</p>

<p>The Indians are very superstitious. Otto Stoll, author
of "Suggestion und Hypnotismus,"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> showed a friendly
Cakchiquel Indian one of his hairs under the microscope.
The Indian asked to have it back that he might preserve
it, saying that if it were lost, it would turn into a snake,
and he would then have to suffer great trouble through
snakes all his life. When Dr. Stoll appeared to be
sceptical, he told him that he had often seen the long
hairs which native women combed out and let fall into
the river, become transformed into serpents as they fell.
This is a widespread belief, and in an early Mexican
dictionary by Molina, in 1571, the word "tzoncoatl" is
translated, "the snake which is formed out of horse's
hair which fell into the water."</p>

<p>The white snake especially may sometimes be a lovely
transformed maiden, as appears from the story of a cowboy
who makes a friend of a white snake which comes to
play with him and twines about his legs. One evening
in midsummer he beholds a fair maiden, who says she is
the daughter of an Eastern king and has been forced to
spend her life through enchantment in the form of a
white snake, with permission to resume human shape on
midsummer night every quarter of a century. The cowboy
is the first human being who has not shrunk from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
when she appears in reptile form. She tells him that she
will come again, and will wind herself three times round
his body and give him three kisses. If he should shrink
from her then she will have to remain a snake for ever.
When she appears, the youth stands firm while the reptile
caresses him and, lo and behold, there is a crash and a
flash and he finds himself in a magnificent palace, with a
beautiful girl beside him who becomes his wife.</p>

<p>The Russians have a story of some girls bathing, when
a snake comes out of the water and sits upon the clothes
of the prettiest one, saying he will not move till she
promises to marry him. She agrees, and that very night
an army of snakes seize her and carry her beneath the
water, where they become men and women. She stays
for some years with her husband, and is then allowed to
go home and visit her mother. The latter, discovering
the husband's name, goes to the water and calls upon
him. When he comes to the surface she chops off his
head with an axe. Probably the snake-bride has been
told by her husband not to mention his name for fear of
his death, the name being taboo.</p>

<p>In a Zuni legend the daughter of a chief bathes in a
pool sacred to Kolowissa, the serpent of the sea. Kolowissa
in anger appears to the maiden in the form of a
child, whom she takes to her home. There the child
changes into an enormous serpent, who induces her to
go away with him, and when she does so he transforms
himself again into a handsome youth.</p>

<p>Incredulous that such happiness can befall her, she
expresses her doubts to the young man, but he then
shows her his shrivelled snake-skin as proof that he is the
god of the waters and that he loves her well enough to
make her his wife.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>A beautiful girl in New Guinea was beloved by a
chief of a strange tribe, and he was so fearful of entering
her father's territory that he asked a sorcerer for a charm
which would enable him to change into a snake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
moment he crossed the boundary of his own country. In
this form he entered the girl's hut, and on seeing the
reptile she began to scream. Her father, however, was
more astute and saw the serpent was really a man, so he
bade his daughter to go to him, as he must be a great
chief to be thus able to transform himself. She obeyed
his command, and as the serpent went slowly, her father
advised her to burn his tail with a hot banana leaf to
make him hurry. This she also did, but at the boundary
the snake vanished and presently a handsome young
man came up to her and told her he was the serpent,
showing certain burns on his feet and legs in proof of
the statement.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In France the serpent with a jewel in its head is called
<i>vouivre</i>, which is the same as our basilisk or dragon. The
<i>vouivre</i> is a reptile from a yard to two yards long, having
only one eye in its head, which shines like a jewel and is
called the carbuncle. This jewel is regarded as of inestimable
value, and those who can obtain one of
these treasures become enormously rich. Many of the
legends deal with the robbery of this jewel from the
serpent, a crime which is frequently punishable by death
or madness.</p>

<p>The French have several variants of the story of St.
George and the Dragon. At the castle of Vaugrenans,
for instance, there lived a lovely lady whose beauty had
led her far astray from the path of virtue. She was
changed into a basilisk and terrorised the country by her
misdeeds. Her son George was a handsome knight, whose
natural piety led him to live a life of good deeds. George
decided that he must set his country free from the
depredations of the monster reptile, which never ceased
to prey upon the neighbourhood and he did battle with
it as once the archangel, St. Michael, had combated the
dragon. George killed the serpent and his horse trampled
what remained of it beneath its hoofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>George was very sad, however, in spite of his victory,
and he asked St. Michael, who had witnessed the struggle,
what was the punishment for one who had slain his own
mother.</p>

<p>"He ought to be burnt," replied St. Michael, "and
his ashes strewn to the winds."</p>

<p>So George had to suffer the penalty of being burnt
and his ashes were scattered to the winds. So far the
story bears a marked resemblance to the family story of
the Lambton worm, but the French tale has a curious
sequel. The ashes fell in one heap instead of scattering
to the wind, and a young girl who was passing gathered
them up. Near by she found an apple of Paradise, which
she ate. In due course she gave birth to a son, and when
the infant was baptised, it cried in a loud tone of voice,
"I am called George and I have been born on this earth
for the second time." Later he was made a saint.</p>

<p>The Roman genius, which accompanies every man
through life as his protector, frequently took the shape
of a serpent.</p>

<p>In many lands, by eating a snake, wisdom is acquired,
or the language of animals mastered, and generally a
particular snake is mentioned by name. Thus with
Arabs and Swahilis it is the king of snakes: among
Swedish, Danish, Celtic or Slavonic peoples it is a white
snake or the fabulous basilisk with a crown on its head,
which resembles the jewel-headed serpent of Eastern
lore.</p>

<p>In the country of Râma there stood a brick stupa or
tower, about a hundred feet high, in the time of Hiuen-Tsiang.
The stupa constantly emitted rays of glory,
and by the side of it was a Naga tank. The Naga frequently
changed his appearance into that of a man, and,
as such, encircled the tower in the practice of religion,
that is, he turned religiously with his right hand towards
the tower.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In New Guinea it is believed that a witch is possessed
by spirits which can be expelled in the form of snakes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Among the Ainus, madness is explained as possession by
snakes. The Zulus believe that an ancestor who wishes
to approach a kraal takes serpent shape. In Madagascar
different species of snakes are the abode for different
classes, one for common people, one for chiefs, and one
for women, and in certain parts of Europe it is solemnly
believed that people may assume serpent-form during
sleep.</p>

<p>The fact that the serpent-stories of the nature here
collected, are so numerous seems to point to a definite
occult connection between the highest living organism,
man, who is represented by a vertical line, and the reptile,
the serpent, represented by the horizontal line, the two
together forming the right angle.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<br />
CAT AND COCK PHANTOMS</h3>


<p>The cat, as appears from many legends, easily holds the
place amongst mystic animals that the serpent has among
reptiles, partly no doubt because of its close relationship
with sorcerers and witches.</p>

<p>Among the strange animal-gods and goddesses of Egypt
none is more famous than the goddess Sekhet and Bast
of Bubastis, who sometimes has the head of a lion, sometimes
of a cat. The early inhabitants of the valley of the
Nile were better acquainted with the lion than with the
cat, which was first introduced from Nubia in the eleventh
dynasty. In the time of the old Empire there was no
cat-headed deity chiefly because there were no cats.
When once introduced, the cat became a sacred animal
and Sekhet's lion-head was superseded by a milder feline
form. The Egyptians also believed that Diana, wishing
to escape from giants, chose to hide herself in the form
of a cat.</p>

<p>Cats, like foxes, are credited in Japan with the power of
assuming human shape in order to bewitch mankind.
The two-tailed vampire cat destroys a beautiful maiden
and, taking her form, preys on a handsome prince.</p>

<p>A man who kills a cat is liable to be possessed by a
cat, and he prevents this if he eats part of the animal.
This homeopathic cure is called cat-punishment. At
Aix in Provence, on the day of Corpus Christi, the largest
tom-cat is dressed in swaddling clothes and publicly
exhibited in a magnificent shrine.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a well-known story of a traveller who saw a
procession of cats in a ruined abbey lowering a small
coffin with a crown on it into a grave. Filled with fear,
he rushed from the spot and later told his vision to a
friend. The friend's cat lay curled up quietly before the
fire, but, hearing the story, it sprang up and crying out,
"Now I am king of the cats!" disappeared in a flash up
the chimney.</p>

<p>An inhabitant of Toulon told Bérenger-Feraud,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> in
1875, that one of his friends had a wizard cat. Every
evening the cat used to listen to their conversation, and
if the subject interested him, he expressed his own
opinion, usually saying the last word on the topic. If his
mistress had any plans on hand, she consulted the cat,
giving her reasons for taking one course or another.
After having weighed the pros and cons carefully, the
cat used to advise her by saying "yes" or "no" as to
whether her plans could be carried out or not.</p>

<p>The cat used to speak whenever he wanted food, asking
either for fish or meat to be purchased, and he talked
very indignantly if the required dainty was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>From time to time this uncanny animal disappeared
for many days at a stretch; and the members of the
household were convinced that he had taken human form
in his absence. He always used to speak before leaving
and after returning.</p>

<p>When he lay on the point of death he prayed that his
body might be decently buried, and his mistress gave
him a solemn promise to this effect and laid the corpse
in a box which she interred behind the cemetery wall.
She dare not bury it in the grave prepared for human
beings, but the coffin was laid alongside a Christian tomb,
and at the funeral the cat's soul was recommended to
the care of his Creator.</p>

<p>Wizard cats have been known to do serious harm to
those against whom they have a grudge, and it is well to
be sure, if you value your life, whether you are dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with a real animal or a "familiar" when you feel angry.</p>

<p>A young man in Radnorshire had the reputation of
being very cruel to cats. On the day he was to
be married he saw a cat cross his path, and he threw a
stone at it. From that moment he weakened in health
and had to go away frequently to recuperate. The
neighbours said that during these absences he was changed
into a cat and ran wild in the woods and, after his death,
tradition declared that he wandered through the district
at night in the shape of a cat and struck terror in the
hearts of naughty children.</p>

<p>General Sir Thomas Edward Gordon tells the following
story of a modern instance in which a man was said
to be transformed into a cat after death.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>"For twenty-five years an oral addition to the written
standing orders of the native guard at Government
House near Poona had been communicated regularly
from one guard to another on relief, to the effect that
any cat passing out of the front door after dark was to
be regarded as His Excellency the Governor, and to be
saluted accordingly. The meaning of this was that Sir
Robert Grant, Governor of Bombay, had died there in
1838, and on the evening of the day of his death a cat
was seen to leave the house by the front door and walk
up and down a particular path, as had been the Governor's
habit to do after sunset. A Hindu sentry had observed
this, and he mentioned it to the others of his faith, who
made it a subject of superstitious conjecture, the result
being that one of the priestly class explained the mystery
of the dogma of the transmigration of the soul from one
body to another, and interpreted the circumstance to
mean that the spirit of the deceased Governor had entered
into one of the house pets.</p>

<p>"It was difficult to fix on a particular one, and it was
therefore decided that every cat passing out of the main
entrance after dark was to be regarded as the tabernacle
of Governor Grant's soul, and to be treated with due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
respect and the proper honours. This decision was
accepted without question by all the native attendants
and others belonging to Government House. The whole
guard, from sepoy to sibadar, fully acquiesced in it, and
an oral addition was made to the standing orders that the
sentry at the front door would 'present arms' to any
cat passing out there after dark."</p>

<p>A strange cat-story is told in "Notes and Queries," by
a writer who knew the lady who had seen the ghost.</p>

<p>The lady was living with her father about 1840 in an
ancient country-house which he had rented from an
elderly heiress. The inmates soon discovered that the
house was haunted. Strange noises were heard from
time to time in the dining-room at night: a mysterious
black cat used to appear in the entrance hall in the evening
and scamper straight up the main staircase&mdash;not ascending
it in the manner of mortal cats, but by winding itself
in and out of the balustrade in a decidedly uncanny and
preternatural way; and, worst of all, an old gentleman,
in a black skull cap, yellow dressing-gown and red slippers,
would come at midnight out of a certain door, cross the
hall, go upstairs (in a dignified manner and not as the cat
did) and vanish into an empty bedroom on the first floor.
All the members of the household used to hear the noises
and see the old gentleman whenever they were awake
and downstairs at midnight. As to the "tortuous cat,"
it was vouched for by the servants and duly recorded by
the lady who told the story. At length the inmates,
finding the situation unpleasant, courageously determined
to beard the ghost and give the old gentleman a
practical and straightforward remonstrance about his
conduct. On a certain night four men-servants were
accordingly posted on the staircase, at the head of the
first flight of stairs, it having been arranged that they
should stop the intruder if they could, while their master,
with a loaded pistol, should follow him and cut off his
retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>At midnight the venerable gentleman emerged from
his accustomed door. "Here he is!" cried the master
of the house, and the servants on the staircase held their
ground whilst the old gentleman approached silently,
apparently unconscious of their presence. He came close
up to the dauntless four, and then, to their amazement,
he passed straight through them and reappeared on the
other side. Turning round, they saw him calmly gliding
up the second flight of stairs, above that on which they
were posted. The master of the house, calling on them
to follow, gave chase and fired his revolver. The old
gentleman took no notice of the shot and entered the
empty bedroom as usual, through its closed door. His
pursuers opened the door only to find the room empty.
A thorough search was made, the wainscoting sounded,
the chimney explored, the cupboards turned out, and so
forth, but nothing was found but a box containing deeds
and some money in a forgotten closet.</p>

<p>The next morning the occupier wrote to the owner of
the house to tell her of the discovery of the deed-box, and
at the end of his letter, he inquired casually whether any
of her relatives had been noted for a peculiarity of dress.</p>

<p>She replied that her grandfather always used to wear,
when he was at home and in his study, <i>a black skull cap</i>,
<i>a yellow dressing-gown and red slippers</i>.</p>

<p>After the finding of the deed-box the ghost failed to
reappear and the companion phantom cat no longer did
gymnastic exercises on the balustrade.</p>

<p>A different cause no doubt lies at the root of the appearance
of a phantom cat and of a witch-cat, but it is not
always easy to distinguish between the varieties of apparitions.
The animals in the following stories bear
resemblance to witches' familiars.</p>

<p>A woodman whose dinner was stolen from him daily
by a cat made many attempts to waylay the creature.
At last he succeeded in catching it in the act of larceny
and he chopped off one of its paws, only to find on his
return home that his wife had lost a hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>A Frenchwoman at Billancourt was cooking an omelette
when a black cat strayed into the cottage and sat
down near the hearth to watch the operation. At the
critical moment the cat cried out, "The omelette is
done on that side. Turn it." The old woman was indignant
at this aspersion on her culinary knowledge and
she flung the half-cooked omelette at the cat, striking the
animal's face. The next morning she had the satisfaction
of seeing a deep red burn on the cheek of an evil-minded
neighbour.</p>

<p>A woman whose children were always ailing, lived in
the village of Ceyreste near to Ciotat. As soon as one
child recovered another fell ill, and their mother was in
despair, because she could not account for their ailments.</p>

<p>One day, one of her neighbours said, "Do you know,
I feel sure your mother-in-law is injuring the health of
your little ones. She may be a witch."</p>

<p>The woman spoke to her husband about the matter,
and they decided to watch over their children carefully
to see whether their illness was due to evil influence.</p>

<p>One night they were watching without appearing to
do so, when suddenly a black cat approached the cradle
of one of the children, moving with stealth and quite
silently. The husband raised a stick he had picked up
for the purpose and struck the animal violently, intending
to kill it. But the blow was not carefully aimed and he
only succeeded in crushing one of the evil animal's paws.
With a bound it escaped him.</p>

<p>For a day or two afterwards nothing was seen of the
children's grandmother, who usually came on a visit
every day to inquire after the health of her grandchildren.</p>

<p>Then the neighbour said, "She is hiding something
from you. Go and see why she does not come."</p>

<p>The husband followed her advice and went to see his
mother, whom he found with her hand bound up, and
in an extremely bad temper. He pretended not to see
that she had been hurt, and he asked her in the most
natural tone he could summon, why she had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to visit them as usual.</p>

<p>"Whatever should I come to your house for?" she
asked angrily. "Look at the state of my fingers. If I
had been struck by a hatchet instead of a stick, my fingers
would have been cut off and I should have nothing left
but a stump."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Algernon Blackwood has cleverly used this idea of
the astral body assuming cat-shape, and a wound inflicted
on the animal reproducing itself on the physical
counterpart, by means of the so-called phenomenon of
repercussion.</p>

<p>In "The Empty Sleeve,"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> the violinist Hyman "believed
that there was some fluid portion of a man's personality
which could be projected to a distance, and even
semimaterialised there. The 'astral body,' he called it,
or some such foolishness, claiming that it could appear in
various forms, according to the character of its owner's
desire, even in animal forms."</p>

<p>Billy Gilmer described to his brother what he saw
when the violinist was playing. "The music seemed to
issue from himself rather than from the shining bit of
wood under his chin, when&mdash;I noticed something coming
over me that was"&mdash;he hesitated, searching for words&mdash;"that
wasn't <i>all</i> due to the music."...</p>

<p>"You mean Hyman looked queer?"</p>

<p>Billy nodded his head without turning.</p>

<p>"Changed there before my very eyes"&mdash;he whispered
it&mdash;"turned animal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Animal!</i>" John felt his hair rising.</p>

<p>"That's the only way I can put it. His face and hands
and body turned otherwise than usual. I lost the sound
of his feet. When the bow-hand or the fingers on the
strings passed into the light, they were"&mdash;he uttered a
soft, shuddering little laugh&mdash;"furry, oddly divided, the
fingers massed together. And he paced stealthily. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
thought every instant the fiddle would drop with a crash
and he would spring at me across the room."</p>

<p>Some weeks later John Gilmer is awakened by a noise
in the flat, and seizing a Turkish sword from the wall
where it hung he entered the sitting-room where he saw
a moving figure.</p>

<p>"Clutching his Turkish sword tightly he drew back
with the utmost caution against the wall and watched,
for the singular impression came to him that the movement
was not that of a human being crouching, but
rather of something that pertained to the animal world.
He remembered, flash-like, the movements of reptiles,
the stealth of the larger felines, the undulating glide of
great snakes. For the moment, however, it did not
move, and they faced one another.</p>

<p>"The other side of the room was but dimly lighted,
and the noise he made clicking up another electric lamp
brought the thing flying forwards again&mdash;<i>towards himself</i>.
At such a moment it seemed absurd to think of so small
a detail, but he remembered his bare feet, and, genuinely
frightened, he leaped upon a chair and swished with his
sword through the air about him. From this better
point of view, with the increased light to aid him, he
then saw two things&mdash;first, that the glass case usually
covering the Guarnerius violin had been shifted: and,
secondly, that the moving object was slowly elongating
itself into an upright position. Semi-erect and yet most
oddly, too, like a creature on its hind legs, it was coming
swiftly towards him. It was making for the door&mdash;and
escape."</p>

<p>Confused, he struck out wildly, lost his balance and
fell forward from the chair.</p>

<p>"Then came the most curious thing of all, for as he
dropped, the figure also dropped, stooped low down,
crouched, dwindled amazingly in size, and rushed past
him close to the ground like an animal on all fours. John
Gilmer screamed, for he could no longer contain himself.
Stumbling over the chair as he turned to follow, cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and slashing wildly with his sword, he saw half-way down
the darkened corridor beyond, the large, scuttling outline
of&mdash;a cat!</p>

<p>"The door into the outer landing was somehow ajar,
and the next second the beast was out, but not before
the steel had fallen with a dreadful crashing blow upon
the front disappearing leg, almost severing it from the
body."</p>

<p>Months afterwards the Gilmers met Hyman wearing
spectacles and a beard. William pointed out to his
brother another difference.</p>

<p>"But didn't you also notice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He had an empty sleeve."</p>

<p>"An empty sleeve?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said William. "<i>He's lost an arm!</i>"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>A daring cat-story is of French origin and bears distinctive
national characteristics on the face of it. On the
26th of March, 1782, a gentleman of wealth who was
jealous of his wife's honour, decided he would consult
Count Cagliostro, in order to find out whether his wife,
who was young and beautiful, had always been faithful
to him. He told the Count the reason of his visit and
begged him to assist him in discovering the truth. Cagliostro
said that this was quite an easy matter, and that
he would give him a small phial containing a certain
liquid which he was to drink when he reached home and
just before he went to bed. "If your wife has been
unfaithful to you," said Cagliostro, "you will be transformed
into a cat."</p>

<p>The husband went home and told his wife how clever
the Count was. She asked him the reason of his journey.
At first he refused to tell her, but when she insisted he
told her the exact means by which he was going to test
her fidelity. She laughed at his credulity, but he swallowed
the draught and they went to bed. The wife rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
early to attend to her household duties, leaving her husband
asleep. At ten o'clock, as he did not appear, she
went up to wake him, and to her intense astonishment,
she found a huge black cat in the bed in place of her
husband. She screamed, called her dear husband's name,
and bent over the cat to kiss it, but without avail. <i>Her
husband had vanished!</i> Then, in her despair, she knelt
beside the bed and prayed for pardon, saying that she
had committed a sin and that a handsome young soldier
had cajoled her, by means of vows, of tears, and stories
of heroic battles, to forget her marriage vows.</p>

<p>Black cocks and hens&mdash;like the cat&mdash;appear to have
affinity with ghosts and sorcery. Among the fauna of
La Franche Comté black hens are found, gifted with
supernatural powers, which are so much like the ordinary
ones that it is difficult to tell them apart. Yet they are
magicians well versed in sorcery. In the courtyard they
are served before their companions, and when they become
broody and sit on the nest, a piece of money is
slipped beneath them. If they are pleased, other coins
are added, but it is very difficult to please them. At
Mouthe in the Jura mountains, there are said to be
witch-hens that frighten eagles.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Cocks are also thought
to have power over lions. Proches gives an example of a
spirit which was wont to appear in the form of a lion,
but by setting of a cock before it, it was made to disappear,
because there is a contrariety between a cock
and a lion.</p>

<p>If an unexpected fortune is left to a poor peasant the
French say that "he has a black hen," and the black hen
which brings treasure is given by the devil to those who
have sold their soul to him. A black cock is regarded as
lucky,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and use is made of it in ceremonial magic.</p>

<p>Oromasis, father of Zoroaster, possessed a gold-finding
hen which was hatched in the following manner. "Take
aromatic woods, such as aloes, cedar, orange, citron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
laurel, iris-root, with rose leaves dried in the sun. Place
them in a golden chafing-dish, pour balsamic oil over
them: add the finest incense and clear gum. Next say:
<i>Athas</i>, <i>Solinain</i>, <i>Erminatos</i>, <i>Pasaim</i>: set a glass over the
chafing dish: direct the rays of the sun thereon, and
the wood will kindle, the glass will melt, a sweet odour
will fill the place, and the compost will burn speedily to
ashes. Place these ashes in a golden egg while still red-hot:
lay the egg upon a black cushion; cover it with a
bell-glass of faceted rock-crystal; then lift up your eyes
and stretch your arms towards heaven and cry: <i>O
Sanataper</i>, <i>Ismaï</i>, <i>Nontapilus</i>, <i>Ertivaler</i>, <i>Canopistus</i>. Expose
the glass to the most fierce rays of the sun till it
seems enveloped in flame, the egg ceases to be visible and
a slight vapour rises. Presently you will discern a black
pullet just beginning to move, when, if you say: <i>Binusas</i>,
<i>Testipas</i>, it will take wing and nestle in your bosom."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>An alternative method provided by the Grimoire is to
take an unspotted egg, and expose it to the meridian
rays of the sun. Then select the blackest hen you can
get, and shut it in a box lined with black. Place the box
in a darkened room and let the hen sit till it hatches the
chicken, which should be as black as the hen's outlook.
The black pullet should have gold-finding proclivities.
Another method altogether is to secure a virgin black
hen, which must be seized without causing it to cackle.
Repair to the highroad, walk till you come to a cross-way,
and there, on the stroke of midnight, describe a circle
with a cypress rod, place yourself in the middle, tear the
bird in twain, and pronounce thrice the words <i>Eloïm</i>,
<i>Essaim</i>, <i>frugativi et appellavi</i>. Next turn to the east,
kneel down, recite a prayer, and conclude it with
the Grand Appellation, when the Unclean Spirit will
appear to you in a scarlet surcoat, a yellow vest, and
breeches of pale green. His head will resemble that of a
dog, but his ears will be those of an ass, with two horns
above them; he will have the legs and hoofs of a calf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
He will ask for your orders, which you will give as you
please, and as he cannot do otherwise than obey you,
you may become rich on the spot, and thus the happiest
of men. Such at least is the judgment of the Grimoire.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Samuel Bernard, the Jewish banker who died in 1789,
left an enormous fortune. It was said that he possessed
a favourite black cock as a mascot, which was thought by
many to have supernatural powers and to be connected in
the diabolical manner indicated with the amassing of his
wealth. The bird died a day or two before his master.</p>

<p>At Basle, in 1474, a cock was tried for having laid an
egg. After a long examination the cock was condemned
to death, not as a cock but as a sorcerer or devil in the
form of a cock. The bird was burned with its egg at the
stake! In former times all animals were regarded as
amenable to the laws of the country and the whole
proceedings of the trial, sentence, and execution were
conducted with the strictest formalities of justice.
Ninety-two processes against animals were tried in the
French courts between 1120 and 1740, when the last
trial and execution of a cow took place.</p>

<p>At Lavegny, in 1457, a sow and her six young ones
were tried for having murdered and partly eaten a child.
The sow was found guilty and executed, but the pigs
were acquitted on account of their youth and the bad
example of their mother.</p>

<p>Such instances might be multiplied in number, but
they have no real place here, as the victims of justice
were not regarded in the light of human animals, but as
animals which had broken the standard of conduct laid
down for the so-called superior race.</p>

<p>Chanticleer is the name of the cock in the great beast
epic of the Middle Ages, Reynard the Fox, and Chanticleer,
as everyone knows, has been humanised and immortalised
in recent years by the famous French dramatist,
Rostand. The cock, the hawk, and the eagle, among
birds, appear to attract wizards or male sorcerers for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
transformation purposes, while the more graceful and
docile feathered beings, such as the nightingale, the
wren, and above all the swan, appeal more frequently to
the witch or maiden as a suitable form in which to appear.</p>

<p>Admirers of William Blake's work will remember the
curious conception of a woman with a swan's head
depicted in his "Jerusalem."</p>

<p>After the classic swan-maidens and Valkyries, perhaps
the owl-woman comes next in popularity, made famous
no doubt by the transformation of Pamphile in "The
Metamorphosis, or Golden Ass of Apuleius."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<br />
BIRD WOMEN</h3>


<p>A beautiful girl of about twenty years of age lived in a
Provençal village. Her figure was good, she had an
engaging carriage, fine hair, lovely eyes and teeth, and,
in short, she was very attractive, but none of the young
men of the village ever attempted to make love to her,
and she had never had an offer of marriage. Whenever
she met a young man who was new to the neighbourhood,
he said, "Oh, what a pretty girl!" But his friends
whispered in his ear, "Yes, she's lovely but she's a witch,"
and the mere suspicion of such a thing was so unpleasant
that the young man knew it was quite impossible to give
the lady a second sympathetic thought.</p>

<p>A few courageous young men, it is true, were anxious to
hear further details about her sad story, and their friends
gave them the following account as soon as they were out
of earshot of any curious listener.</p>

<p>The young girl's mother, it appeared, had become a
witch in her early youth, because, finding herself at the
bedside of an old neighbour who lay at death's door and
who was a notorious witch, she had been imprudent
enough to take hold of her hand. Her indiscretion had
not at the time become public property, and she had no
difficulty in getting a husband, but a very short time
after the marriage had taken place, the man had fallen
ill, and died soon afterwards in a mysterious decline.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances there could be no doubt
that the daughter was a witch as well as the mother, and
it was equally certain that any bold gentleman who
might venture to marry her would be condemned to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
early death.</p>

<p>Whether the young lady in question was pleased at the
prospect of being laid on the shelf is very doubtful.
Most girls of twenty have not an idea in the world beyond
getting married, and she did not seem to be an exception
to the rule.</p>

<p>One day a nice-looking young man who had recently
come to the district to take up a position of some importance,
was much struck by the young lady's good
looks. When a friend told him she was undoubtedly a
witch he shrugged his shoulders in contemptuous incredulity
and continued to glance at her with interest
and even tenderness in his gaze.</p>

<p>He was specially favoured by the girl, who received
his attentions with pleasure and returned his glances.
They soon made one another's acquaintance and, before
long, an engagement was arranged between them.</p>

<p>The young man's family looked upon the forthcoming
marriage with anything but good-will. But the young
lover was obstinate, and as the girl and her mother did
their best to keep him to his intentions, the arrangements
were settled and the wedding-day fixed.</p>

<p>The fiancé was allowed to pay court to his lady-love
every evening, and he made good use of this privilege.
Autumn was approaching and the evenings were drawing
in, and as the wedding was to be in November, there
were many things to arrange and discuss every day,
which made long visits a matter of course.</p>

<p>Time and time again one of the young man's friends
pointed out the danger into which he was running by
marrying a witch, but all advice was useless. It had an
effect in one way, however, as it made the young man
anxious to know whether the accusation could possibly
be true. After a long time, in which his friend's suggestions
had slowly made an impression, the young man
decided to take steps to make sure what sort of a
woman he was about to marry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the witches' Sabbath
begins exactly at midnight, and once or twice when it
grew very late whilst he was visiting his fiancée, her
mother had suggested it was time he took his leave as it
was close on midnight. This occurrence had made him
slightly suspicious, and he decided to resort to a ruse.</p>

<p>One evening, having arrived at the usual hour, he
complained of fatigue and pretended to fall asleep.
Being Friday, the meeting of the witches was a specially
solemn one, and not a single witch could afford to be
absent. As time wore on, mother and daughter tried to
wake the young man, but this was impossible, as he was
sleeping too heavily, even snoring in a marked fashion,
although all the time he was prepared to glance out of
one eye if anything extraordinary went on in the room.</p>

<p>Presently, finding all their efforts in vain, the two women
began talking in whispers, and were seemingly in great
trouble. Then, as time pressed on, they took a mighty
resolution. They put out the light, so that the room
was in utter darkness save for the glowing embers on the
hearth, then they took from a hidden press a jar of ointment
which they placed on the table. They quickly
divested themselves of their clothes and, dipping their
fingers into the jar, rubbed themselves all over very
carefully with the ointment. Every time they rubbed a
limb they cried out, "Supra fueillo&mdash;above the foliage!"</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished this ritual they suddenly
became owls, flew up the chimney, uttering the lugubrious
hoot of the night-bird, and leaving behind them no signs
of their presence except their discarded clothes on a chair
in the room which had been the stage of this strange
transformation.</p>

<p>As soon as he was left alone, the young man opened
his eyes in a state of indescribable stupefaction. He rose,
lit the lamp, looked carefully all round the room, touching
many of the things to make sure that he was really awake
and that he had not been the subject of an hallucination.
When he came to the clothes, which still felt
warm from their owners' bodies, and saw on the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the jar of black ointment which smelt as though it had
been made of burnt animal fat, he knew he was not
dreaming.</p>

<p>Just then a clock close by struck the hour of twelve,
and the young man, shaking and quaking with the
strangeness of what had taken place, looked round in
fear lest some awful apparition should greet his eyes.
But nothing happened, for all the witches were at the
Sabbath by that time.</p>

<p>Then a mad idea entered his head! Why should not
he, too, transform himself into an owl and go to join
his future wife and her mother, who had effected the
transformation without apparently the slightest difficulty.
The idea had no sooner struck him than he prepared to
carry it out. In the twinkling of an eye he slipped off
his clothes, dipped his fingers into the magic jar and
rubbed himself exactly as the women had done. Unfortunately,
however, he could not remember the exact
phrase they had used, and instead of crying "Supra
fueillo," he said, "Souto fueillo&mdash;under the foliage,"
with every rub.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he completed his exercises, and said
"Souto fueillo" for the last time, than he was immediately
changed into an owl and flew towards the chimney.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he reached the grate, however, when he
knocked against the smouldering green faggots and burnt
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>He attributed this misadventure to his want of address,
not being accustomed to the shape and movements of a
bird, and he assured himself that as soon as he was free
of the house he would manage better. But when he
reached the open country he began to suffer tortures.
Where the fields were bare he found himself easily able
to fly, just like any ordinary owl, but as soon as he came
to the smallest hedge or thicket, he was obliged to pass
through it instead of clearing it from above, and every
branch, twig or thorn hit and stung him like a whip.</p>

<p>He wished to stop flying, for every moment his suffering
grew more unendurable, but it was impossible to
stop, for he was induced by some superior power to go
straight ahead, and however much he tried, he could not
avoid the shrubs and trees which lay in his path. The
words "souto fueillo&mdash;under the foliage" which he had
used were literally true, in the most cruel sense. He was
bruised and torn all over, and felt as though he were at
the point of death and that his last moment had come,
when suddenly he heard a cock crow and the first ray of
light appeared in the sky, heralding the dawn. The
witches' Sabbath ended, he fell heavily to earth, finding
himself lying naked on the wet soil. Bruised and
bleeding, and smarting from a hundred scratches, his
condition was pitiable, but he took heart when he realised
that his experiment, so foolishly attempted, had not
turned out even worse. He stood up, and limping and
sore, hastened to his own house, slinking into bed, where
he developed a serious fever which kept him there for
many weeks. No one ever guessed the real cause of his
illness, but as soon as he had recovered his ordinary state
of health he went to live in another town and never even
called on his ex-fiancée and her mother to ask them for
the clothes which he had left on a chair in their sitting-room.</p>

<p>A legend about another owl-woman is alluded to by
Shakespeare in Hamlet, Act IV, Sc. V, in Ophelia's
speech, "They say the owl was a baker's daughter."
The common version of this story comes from Gloucestershire,
and is told as follows: "Our Saviour went into a
baker's shop where they were baking and asked for some
bread to eat. The mistress of the shop immediately
put a piece of dough into the oven to bake for him, but
was reprimanded by her daughter who, insisting that
the piece of dough was too large, reduced it considerably
in size. The dough, however, immediately afterwards
began to swell, and presently became an enormous size.
Whereupon the baker's daughter cried out, 'Wheugh!
wheugh! wheugh!' which owl-like noise, it is said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
probably induced our Saviour, for her wickedness, to
transform her into that bird."</p>

<p>An old ode gives a more aristocratic descent to the
owl than the family of a tradesman.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Once I was a monarch's daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sat on a lady's knee:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But am now a mighty rover,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Banished to the ivy tree.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Crying hoo hoo, hoo hoo, hoo hoo,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hoo! hoo! hoo! my feet are cold!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pity me, for here you see me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Persecuted, poor and old!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the north country the owl was also said to be of
royal descent, perhaps of birth even as high as the child
of a Pharaoh.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I was once a king's daughter and sat upon my father's knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But now I am a poor hoolet, and hide in a hollow tree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another common tradition represents the owl as an
old weaver spinning with silver threads, and the barn
owl is said to be a transformation of one of the servants
of the ten kings of the infernal regions.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>A similar story about the Saviour and the dough is told
of the woodpecker. When Christ and St. Peter were
wandering about the earth, they came to a house where
an old wife sat baking. Her name was Gertrude and she
wore a red mutch on her head. The Saviour, being
hungry, pleaded that she should give Him a bannock,
and to this she agreed. She took a very small piece of
dough and rolled it out, but as she was rolling it it grew
bigger and finally covered the whole griddle.</p>

<p>Then she said it was too large and she could not give
away that bannock, and she took up a still smaller piece
of dough and began again. But this piece grew as large
as the other, and she refused to let her visitors have it.
The same thing occurred a third time, and then Gertrude
said, "I can't give you anything. You will have to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
without, for all these bannocks are too large."</p>

<p>Then Christ was angry and said, "Since you grudge me
a morsel of food you shall turn into a bird and seek your
livelihood between bark and hole, and only drink when it
rains."</p>

<p>As He spoke these words, Gertrude turned into a
large black woodpecker and flew up from the kneading
trough and out through the chimney. Her body is black
but she still wears the red mutch and she taps at the trees
for her food.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>The Bohemians believe the cuckoo to be a transformed
peasant woman who hid herself when she saw the Saviour
approaching because she feared she would have to give
Him a loaf. After He had gone by she looked out of the
window and cried "Cuckoo!" and thereupon she was
changed into a bird.</p>

<p>Another tradition says that the cuckoo is a transformed
maiden, who is calling for her lost brother, or
else that she proclaims to the world by her cry that her
brother has been found again. A Serbian song says that
a dead man was detained in misery on earth because his
sister persisted in shedding tears over his grave. Becoming
angry at her unreasonable sorrow, he cursed her and
she was changed into a cuckoo and had enough to do
grieving over her own condition without troubling further
about his.</p>

<p>In an Albanian version of this legend a sister had two
brothers, and accidentally killed one of them by getting
up from her needlework and stabbing him in the heart
with her scissors. She and her surviving brother grieved
so deeply that they turned into birds, and all day long
she cried "Ku-ku, ku-ku, Where are you?" to the
brother she had slain.</p>

<p>The Westphalian peasants say that the nightingale is a
shepherdess who treated a shepherd, who loved her,
harshly, for she kept on promising to marry him but was
never prepared to fulfil her vow. At last the shepherd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
could not endure her dilly-dallying any longer and he
prayed that she might never sleep again until the day of
judgment. Since then her voice is always heard at night-time,
singing, "Is tit, is tit, to wit, to wit&mdash;Trizy, Trizy,
to bucht, to bucht"&mdash;which is the cry of the shepherdess
to her dog Trizy.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>"In former times," says Mr. Train, in his "Account of
the Isle of Man,"<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> "a fairy of uncommon beauty exerted
such undue influence over the male population, that by
her sweet voice she induced numbers to follow her footsteps
till by degrees she led them into the sea, where they
perished. This barbarous exercise of power had continued
for a long time, till it was apprehended that the
island would be exhausted of its defenders: when a
knight-errant sprang up who discovered some means of
countervailing the charms used by this siren, and even
laid a plot for her destruction, which she escaped at the
moment of extreme hazard by taking the form of a
wren. But, though she evaded instant annihilation, a
spell was cast upon her by which she was condemned to
animate the same form every succeeding New Year's
day, until she should perish by a human hand." Every
anniversary therefore man and boy hunt the island from
dawn till twilight for the small brown bird whose
feathers are looked upon as a charm against shipwreck.</p>

<p>In German folk-lore the magpie is a bird of the infernal
regions, now changing herself into a witch, or
sometimes turning herself into the steed or broomstick
on which the witch rides to the Sabbath. In Sweden
tradition says that sorcerers on Walpurgis night ride to
Blocula and there turn into magpies. A lady at Carlstadt
in that country was haunted by witch-birds in a very
unpleasant manner. Having insulted a Finn woman
who had begged food of her she told her to take a magpie
that was hanging in a cage and eat it if she was hungry.
The Finn cast an "evil eye" on the lady for this insult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
but took the bird away with her. Some time after the
Swedish lady noticed that whenever she went out a
magpie came hopping in front of her. This happened
for some days running, and then the magpie was joined
by a companion bird, and presently by a number. The
lady began to be frightened, but the more she tried to get
rid of these strange companions the more numerous
they became. They perched on her shoulders, tugged at
her dress, and pecked at her ankles. In despair she shut
herself up indoors, but they remained outside, and as
soon as the door was open in they hopped. At last she
went to bed and had the shutters closed, and the magpies
kept on tapping outside till she died.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful Eskimo legend of a bird-bride:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Years agone, on the flat white strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I won my sweet sea-girl,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wrapped in my coat of the snow-white fur,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I watched the wild-birds settle and stir,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The grey gulls gather and whirl.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One of the greatest of all the flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Perched on an ice-floe bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Called and cried as her heart were broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And straight they were changed that fleet bird-folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To women young and fair."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Eskimo captures the fairest and carries her to his
snow house, where she becomes his wife and bears him
three children, and he promises that whatever bird or
beast he shall slay for food he will never capture another
grey gull. But as time goes on he forgets his vow and
once when food is scarce and he can get no game, he shoots
four sea-gulls with his bow and arrow. Then his wife
tells him her hour has come, and, calling her children to
fetch the feather plumes, she dons them and flies away
with her little ones and the husband is left lamenting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>A more definite variant of the bird-maiden legend is
found in "The Arabian Nights." Janshah enters a pavilion
and mounting the throne falls asleep. But presently
awaking he walks forth and sees flying in mid-sky, three
birds, in dove-form but as large as eagles. They alight
on the brink of the basin of the fountain. There they
become maidens, plunge into the basin and play and
swim in the water. Janshah, struck by their beauty,
rises and follows them when they come to land, saying,
"Who are ye, O illustrious princesses, and whence come
ye?" The youngest maiden replies, "We are from the
invisible world of Almighty Allah, and we come hither
to divert ourselves."</p>

<p>Still marvelling at her beauty, Janshah said to the
youngest, "Have ruth on me and deign kindness to me
and take pity on my case and all that hath befallen me
in my life." But she will not hearken to his pleadings,
and though he recites love poems to them all they only
laugh and sing and make merry. They stay with him
feasting till morning and then, resuming dove-shape, fly
off and are seen no more. Janshah, deprived of their
company, well-nigh loses his reason and falls into a
swoon.</p>

<p>Eventually he wins the princess by seizing her feather
robe and refusing to return it in spite of the fact that the
fair lady, Shamsah by name, beseeches him with all her
wiles to do so. They decide to go back to the princesses'
motherland to be married, and Janshah returns the feather
suit, which she dons, telling him to mount her back and
shut his eyes and ears, so that he "may not hear the roar
of the revolving sphere," and, she adds, "keep fast hold
of my feathers lest thou fall off."</p>

<p>They return to his home happily wedded and Janshah
places the feather-vest of the princess in a white marble
chest, which is sealed with melted lead and buried under
the palace walls. But Shamsah when she enters the new
palace smells the scent of her flying feather-gear, and
when her husband is asleep she gets out the garment and
flies away. Then Janshah has to search for the Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of Jewels, where he meets his fair bride once more.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>A very similar story is told by Charles Swynnerton in
"Romantic Tales from the Panjab, with Indian Nights'
Entertainment,"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> about Prince Bairam and his fairy
bride. The Prince, sitting down in a beautiful garden,
watches four milk-white doves who settle in the shape
of four fairies by the edge of a tank of clear crystal water.
There they bathe and when they come out to dress three
of them resume their dove-shape, but the fourth fairy,
whose name is Ghulab Bano, cannot find her clothes and
bids farewell to her sisters, saying, "It is my kismet.
Some different destiny awaits me here and we shall
never meet again."</p>

<p>Then she falls in love with the Prince, who has purposely
hidden her dove-skin, and marries him. After a
time she asks her husband for leave to visit her father
and mother, promising to return. He gives her the fairy
clothes and she disappears as a milk-white dove. But
her parents are angry with her for marrying a mortal and
imprison her in a subterranean city, so that she cannot keep
her promise. The Prince goes in search of her and at last
finds his bride, but as women cannot keep a secret, she tells
her friends of his presence, and her father sends giants to
kill him, and only after many further adventures are the
Prince and the fairy-Princess once more happily united.</p>

<p>In a Basuto legend a girl is devoured by wer-animals
in whose care, as men, she has been sent to her betrothed.
Her heart is transformed into a dove and joins a flock of
these birds. They visit the hut of the bridegroom's
sister, who suspects that the beautiful bird may be the
lost maiden. Then the bridegroom seizes hold of the
dove, the wings come off and the girl herself steps forth
as beautiful and innocent as ever.</p>

<p>Hans Andersen's "The Wild Swans" differs in an
important particular from the other stories of this class,
as it deals with Swan-princes. Princess Elsie's eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
brothers are transformed into swans by their wicked
stepmother, who says, "Fly away in the form of great
speechless birds." But she could not make their transformation
so disagreeable as she wished, and the princes
were changed into eleven white swans.</p>

<p>Elsie releases them by plucking stinging-nettles which
she has to weave into eleven shirts with long sleeves.
She does not finish in time, and one sleeve being wanting
in the youngest boy's shirt, he has one arm, and a wing
instead of the other.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The robin, oddly enough among birds, is also a transformed
man. The legend is told amongst the Chippeway
Indians that there was once a hunter so ambitious that
his only son should signalise himself by endurance when
he came to the time of life to undergo the fast for the
purpose of choosing his guardian spirit, that after the
lad had fasted for eight days, his father still pressed him
to persevere. But the next day, when the father entered
the hut, his son had paid the penalty of violated nature,
and in the form of a robin had just flown down to the
top of a lodge. There before he flew away to the woods,
he entreated his father not to mourn the transformation.
"I shall be happier," he said, "in my present state than
I could have been as a man. I shall always be the friend
of men and keep near their dwellings; I could not
gratify your pride as a warrior, but I will cheer you
with my songs."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>In Bavaria the hoopoe is said to play the part of attendant
to the cuckoo. It is believed that the plantain was
once a maiden, who, watching by the wayside for her
lover, who was long in coming, was changed into a plant,
and once in seven years she becomes a bird, either the
cuckoo or the hoopoe,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> or, as it is called in Devonshire,
the "dinnick," the cuckoo's servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the best-known classical stories of bird-women
is, of course, the tragedy of Progne and Philomela,
daughters of Pandion, King of Athens. Progne marries
Tereus, King of Thrace, but Tereus, blinded by Philomela's
beauty, betrays his sister-in-law and cuts out her
tongue lest she should tell of his villainy. Nevertheless
she manages to send a message to her sister, who revenges
herself and Philomela on her husband Tereus by killing
his son Itys and dishing up his body as food at a meal
which she sets before his father. Tereus, having eaten
of the flesh of his beloved son, discovers the trick played
upon him and pursues his wife and her sister with the
intention of punishing them. As they flee Philomela is
transformed into a nightingale, while Progne becomes a
swallow, upon whose breast the red stains of her murdered
son appear. Tereus is changed into a crested bird, either
a hoopoe or a lapwing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Thracian king, lamenting sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Turned to a lapwing, doeth them upbrayde."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A pretty story of a woman-kingfisher is also to be
found among the classics. Ceyx, King of Trachyn, sets
out for Claros, to succour his brother, against the advice
of his wife, Halcyone. A storm overtakes the ship on
which he is travelling and he is drowned. Halcyone
hastens to the seashore to find him, as she feels she cannot
live without his presence, and as she stands looking out to
sea the body of the drowned Ceyx floats towards her.
She leaps into the water to seize his corpse and at that
moment is transformed into a kingfisher, and with her
bill and wings caresses the dead face and limbs of her
beloved husband. Then the gods, in compassion, transform
Ceyx also into a kingfisher, so that as birds their
love may endure for ever.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX<br />
<br />
FAMILY ANIMALS</h3>


<p>Certain animals are associated with certain families, and
in many such instances the animal makes its appearance
as a death-warning. Sometimes the animal in question,
which is in the nature of a totem of the clan, is the
family crest and has an occult connection with its
traditions and history.</p>

<p>The Ferrers, whose country seat is at Chartley Park,
near Litchfield, have a peculiar breed of cattle on their
estates. The colour of the cattle is white with black
muzzles. The whole of the inside of the ear, and one-third
of the outside from the tip downwards is red, and
the horns are white, with black tips, very fine and bent
upwards.</p>

<p>In the year in which the Battle of Burton Bridge was
fought and lost, a black calf was born into this stock
and the downfall of the Ferrers family occurred about
this time, giving rise to a tradition which has never been
falsified, that the birth of a dark or parti-coloured calf
from the Chartley Park breed is an omen of death within
the year to a member of the Ferrers family.</p>

<p>The "Staffordshire Chronicle," of July, 1835, says,
"It is a noticeable coincidence that a calf of this description
was born whenever a death happened in the family.
The decease of the seventh Earl Ferrers and of his
countess, and of his son, Viscount Tamworth, and of
his daughter, Mrs. William Jolliffe, as well as the deaths
of the son and heir of the eighth earl and of his daughter,
Lady Francis Shirley, were each preceded by the ominous
birth of the fatal-hued calf. In the spring of 1835 a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
black calf appeared at Chartley, and before long the
beautiful countess, second wife of the eighth earl, lay on
her death-bed.</p>

<p>Birds of various kinds frequently make their appearance
in families as harbingers of death. When the
Oxenhams of Devonshire were visited by the apparition
of a white bird they knew that one of the family was
doomed. The well-known story is told by James Oxenham
in a tract entitled "A True relation of an Apparition
in the likenesse of a Bird with a white breast that
appeared hovering over the death-beds of some of the
children of Mr. James Oxenham, of Sale Monachorum,
Devon, Gent."</p>

<p>One of the first members of the family to see the
apparition was the famous John Oxenham, a young man
of twenty-two, who was taken ill in the vigour of his
youth, a great strapping fellow six foot and a half in
height, well built, of comely countenance and of great
intellectual gifts. He died on the fifth day of September,
1635, and two days before his death the bird with the
white breast hovered over his bed. Charles Kingsley
made use of this incident in "Westward Ho!" John
Oxenham, in the midst of drinking a toast, suddenly
drops his glass on the table and staring in terror at some
object which he seems to see fluttering round the room,
he cries out "There! Do you see it? The bird! The
bird with the white breast!"</p>

<p>No sooner was John Oxenham in his grave than the
apparition showed itself to Thomasine, wife of James
Oxenham, who died on the seventh of September, 1635.
She was quite a young woman and, according to the
witnesses, Elizabeth Frost and Joan Tooker, the strange
phantom was seen clearly fluttering above her sick-bed.
The next member of the Oxenhams to whom the warning
appeared was Thomasine's little sister, Rebecca, a child of
eight, who breathed her last on September the ninth,
following. And no sooner had the little girl been laid in
her grave than Thomasine, infant of the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Thomasine and James Oxenham, was taken sick and died
on the 15th of September, 1635, the bird appearing
also in this case.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to wonder what disease it was that
carried off so many members of the Oxenham family
within a few days of one another, and whether the bird
was fluttering through the rooms the whole of the time,
or whether it disappeared between the various deaths.
Certain it is that it was not seen hovering over the sick-beds
of other members of the family who recovered
health. An earlier visitation had occurred in 1618, when
the grandmother of the said John, a certain Grace Oxenham,
had yielded up her soul into the hands of her Maker.
Many later appearances of the famous bird are on record.
A Mr. Oxenham who lived in Sidmouth for many years
and who died between 1810 and 1821, was attended by
an old gardener and his wife, who gave evidence that they
had seen a white bird fly in at the door, dart across the
bed in which their master lay dying, and <i>disappear in
one of the drawers of the bureau</i>, but when they opened all
the drawers to find the apparition, they could discover
no signs of it.</p>

<p>In 1873 the Rev. Henry Oxenham gave the following
version of the family story, which may be found in
Frederick George Lee's "Glimpses of the Supernatural."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>"Shortly before the death of my late uncle, G. N.
Oxenham, Esq., of 17 Earl's Terrace, Kensington, who
was then head of the family, this occurred: His only
surviving daughter, now Mrs. Thomas Peter, but then
unmarried and living at home, and a friend of my aunt's,
Miss Roberts, who happened to be staying in the house,
but was no relation, and had never heard of the family
tradition, were sitting in the dining-room immediately
beneath his bedroom about a week before his death,
which took place on December 15, 1873, when their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
attention was aroused by a shouting outside the window.</p>

<p>"On looking out they observed a white bird&mdash;which
might have been a pigeon, but, if so, was an unusually
large one&mdash;perched on the thorn tree outside the windows
and it remained there for several minutes, in spite of
some workmen on the opposite side of the road throwing
their hats at it, in the vain effort to drive it away.</p>

<p>"Miss Roberts mentioned this to my aunt at the time,
though not, of course, attaching any special significance
to it, and my aunt (since deceased) repeated it to me
soon after my uncle's death. Neither did my cousin,
though aware of the family tradition, think of it at the
time.... My cousin also mentioned another circumstance,
which either I did not hear of or had forgotten,
viz. that my late aunt spoke at the time of frequently
hearing a sound like the fluttering of a bird's wings in my
uncle's bedroom, and said that the nurse testified to
hearing it also."</p>

<p>A more tragic incident connected with the same legend
was that when Lady Margaret Oxenham was about to be
married a white bird appeared and fluttered about her
head, and that she was stabbed at the altar by a rejected
lover.</p>

<p>In another family a white crow was seen as a death-warning.
In the late half of the eighteenth century the
son of a rich landowner in North Wales was said to
exercise an evil influence over his elder brother, who was
heir to the estate. When the landowner died the eldest
son disappeared mysteriously, and the second son took
his place as heir. Wherever the new squire went he was
accompanied by a white crow with black wings, and all
the neighbours recognised the bird as his constant
companion.</p>

<p>A few years passed and the squire found it necessary
to make a journey to London on a matter of business,
but thinking that the crow would cause an odd sensation
if it followed him about the Metropolis, he decided, or
let himself be persuaded, that it was better to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
bird behind. On his way home from town, he stayed for
a night or two at the house of a friend in Shrewsbury.
During dinner the door of the dining-room was blown
open suddenly, as though by an unexpected gust of wind,
and the white crow flew into the room and perched on
the squire's shoulder, as though well-contented to be
once more in the presence of its master.</p>

<p>To satisfy the curiosity of the guests, the squire explained
that the bird was his most faithful friend. When
the diners left the table and went into the drawing-room
a pet dog chased the bird, which had left its perch on
the squire's shoulder and had flown on ahead. One of
the visitors attempted to strike the dog, hoping to make
it cease to persecute the bird, and by accident he hit the
bird instead. Croaking piteously, the white crow wheeled
about twice and fluttered to the ground dying. The
squire who had lingered behind the others came forward
at the noise of the fray and, seeing the dead crow,
cried:</p>

<p>"Alas! You have killed one who was to me like a
brother."</p>

<p>Then he turned to his host and took a hurried farewell,
for, he added, "I have but three weeks more to live."</p>

<p>At this strange speech the host and his guests concluded
that the squire was over-superstitious and they
pooh-poohed his fears, which, however, proved only too
correct. He died three weeks later, as he had himself
prophesied, and then it was reported that the elder
brother, on his disappearance, had taken the shape of a
crow and that whoever owned the bird knew that he
would only survive it by three weeks. A third brother
inherited the estate, and to this day when a death is expected
in the family, a white crow with black wings is
seen hovering near the house.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>A bird is connected with a death-warning in the
Lyttleton family, whose country seat is Hagley in Worcestershire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
The first earl was a distinguished poet and
historian, but his son, Thomas, the second earl, was
known as "the wicked Lord Lyttleton," a title he had
won by his extravagances and profligacy. He died on
November 27th, 1779, at his town house in Hill Street,
having been foretold of his death three days previously.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night of the 24th of November
he was awakened by the fluttering of a bird about the
curtains in his bedroom, and looking up, he saw the vision
of a lovely woman dressed in white, upon whose wrist a
small bird was perched like a falcon. As he lay watching
the apparition, the woman spoke, warning him to prepare
for death within three days.</p>

<p>Although he treated the matter lightly, and his friends
seconded him in combating his superstitious fears, Lord
Lyttleton died at the exact hour named by his ghostly
visitor and the casement at which the bird was seen by
the doomed man has since been frequently pointed out
to people interested in the tradition.</p>

<p>Closeburn Castle, the seat of the Kirkpatricks in Dumfries-shire,
was surrounded by a beautiful lake, and whenever
any member of the family was about to die a swan
appeared on the waters and remained there until the
death had taken place, then disappearing as mysteriously
as it came.</p>

<p>The story of this ghostly swan is a sad one. In former
times a pair of swans made the lake their favourite resort
in the summer season. Year after year the pair paid an
annual visit to Closeburn to the delight of the family,
for they were thought to bring good fortune in their
train, and whatever misfortune or sorrow had been impending
vanished like magic at their appearance.</p>

<p>One Lady Kirkpatrick had been sick unto death when
the first information of the presence of the swans brought
her speedily back to health. Another year the heir of the
house, a mere babe, lay almost at his last gasp when the
broken-hearted mother, gazing from the castle window
one dark night, saw the two swans descend as though from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the celestial world, and the next moment they were seen
sailing majestically upon the lake. Full of joy at this
good omen, she turned to her sick child and saw with
thanksgiving and praise the first signs of returning health,
a recovery which proved to be speedy. And so many
stories were told of kindly influence exerted by the
original birds and their successors, that for one hundred
and fifty years the tradition held good. But after the
elapse of that period a change occurred, which unfortunately
reversed the omen.</p>

<p>At that time Closeburn Castle was in the possession
of a boy of thirteen of the name of Robert. He was
romantic by nature, but also mischievous, and it happened
that one day he was permitted to go to the theatre in
Edinburgh to see a performance of "The Merchant of
Venice." The lines which Portia says of Bassanio, that
he would</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Make a swan-like end<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fading in music,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>struck his imagination very forcibly and afterwards he
could not rest because he was so anxious to know whether
the song of a dying swan was a fact and not merely a
myth.</p>

<p>Moved by this absorbing impulse, he went a short
time later into the Park at Closeburn with the intention
of shooting sparrows with his cross-bow, and at that
moment, unluckily, the prophetic swans came sailing
upon the lake in his direction.</p>

<p>Without a thought as to what might be the result of
his action, Robert aimed his bow at one of the swans, and
the arrow, winging its way over the lake, hit its mark
so surely that the swan perished on the spot. Its companion
gave a shrill and lamentable scream and vanished
forthwith.</p>

<p>Robert, filled with remorse at what he had done,
buried the body of his victim, which had drifted to the
shores of the lake, and told nobody what had taken place.
But for many years, much to the surprise of the family, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
swans came to Closeburn.</p>

<p>Much later, when the matter had been almost forgotten,
a single swan returned, but, unlike the earlier visitants, it
was shy to wildness, and upon its breast was seen a blood-red
stain.</p>

<p>People shook their heads and said this phantom swan
boded the family no good, and their prognostications
came true, for though the swan with the bleeding breast
came more rarely than the others had done, every time
it appeared it heralded misfortune. First the sudden
death of the Lord of Closeburn occurred at home and
then one of his relatives was lost in a shipwreck. And
again at the third nuptials of Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick,
the first baronet of that name, his son and heir Roger,
who was in good health at the time, caught sight of the
swan, and in full conviction that the warning was meant
to tell of impending evil, he went home duly despondent.
His father rallied him on his mood, which he said proceeded
from a jealous dislike of his new stepmother.
But Roger answered, "Perhaps before long, you too
may be sorrowing," and that very night he gave up the
ghost.</p>

<p>Since then, tradition says, that the mystic wounded
swan has never been seen at Closeburn, and the tragic
revenge has been completely fulfilled.</p>

<p>According to the account of Sir Walter Scott, supernatural
appearances announce death to the ancient Highland
family of the MacLeans of Lochbuy. The spirit
of an ancestor who was slain in battle is heard to gallop
along a stony bank and then to ride thrice around the
family residence ringing his fairy bridle and thus intimating
the approaching calamity. The reference to this
legend occurs in "The Lady of the Lake."</p>

<p>A fox is an unusual animal to be responsible for a death-warning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
except perhaps in Japan, where so many superstitions
cling round this creature, but the Irish family of
Gormanston is haunted by a small congregation of foxes
whenever the head of the house is about to die.</p>

<p>Before the death of the twelfth viscount, in 1860,
foxes were seen round about and even in the house for
some days. A few hours before his death, "three foxes
were playing about and making a noise close to the house,
and just in front of the cloisters, which are yew-trees
planted and trailed in that shape." They wandered
about the grounds in pairs and sat under the viscount's
window, barking and howling all night. Next morning
they were crouching in the grass in the front of the
house. Although they had access to the poultry yard,
it was certainly strange that they never touched any of
the birds. As soon as the funeral was over the animals
disappeared suddenly.</p>

<p>When the succeeding viscount died, in 1876, the foxes
were seen again, appearing constantly under the bedroom
window, especially when the sick viscount was supposed
to have taken a turn for the better, which, however,
proved to be a false hope, for he passed away soon afterwards.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the death of the fourteenth Viscount
Gormanston the coachman and gardener saw two
foxes near the chapel and five or six more round the
front of the house, and several were barking in the
cloisters. Lord Gormanston's son, the Hon. Mr. Preston,
watched beside his father's body which lay in the chapel,
and on one occasion, about three in the morning, he
"became conscious of a slight noise, which seemed to be
that of a number of people walking stealthily around the
chapel on the gravel walk. He went to the side door,
listened, and heard outside a continuous and insistent
snuffling or sniffing noise, accompanied by whimperings
and scratchings at the door. On opening it, he saw a
full-grown fox sitting on the path within four feet of
him. Just in the shadow was another, while he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
hear several more moving close by in the darkness. He
then went to the end door, opposite the altar, and on
opening it found two more foxes, one so close that he
could have touched it with his foot. On shutting the
door the noises continued till 5 a.m., when they suddenly
ceased."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>When a death is about to take place in the Baronet's
family at Clifton Hall, in Nottinghamshire, a sturgeon
is said to force its way up the river Trent, which runs at
the foot of the beautifully wooded slope on which the
Hall stands, and whenever white owls are seen perched
on the family mansion of the Arundels of Wardour it is
held to be an indication that a member of the family is
near to death.</p>

<p>In one family a little white dog appears to give warning
that a death is about to occur. The story is taken from
J. A. Middleton's "Grey Ghost Book."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> A relative of
General French was sitting in the garden talking with a
friend when the latter saw a little white dog run under
her companion's chair. As it did not reappear she became
curious and requested him to see what had become of it.
The man rose and removed his chair, but the dog was
not there, having suddenly and mysteriously vanished.
Then he related that in his family a little white dog appeared
before a death, and that this was a warning to him.</p>

<p>Some time after they met again and she learnt that his
uncle had died the same night, and that she had seen the
animal, and when she remarked that it was strange that
it should have been visible to her and not to him, he said
that on many other occasions the phantom had appeared
to someone outside the family, though always near to a
member of it to whom it was visible.</p>

<p>A black dog appears as a death warning to some families,
as related by Catherine Crowe in "The Night Side of
Nature."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>A young lady of well-known family was sitting at work,
well and cheerful, when she saw to her great surprise a
large black dog close to her. As both door and window
were closed she could not understand how he had got
in, but when she started up to put him out she could
no longer see him. Quite puzzled and thinking it must
be some strange illusion, she sat down again, and went
on with her work, when presently he was there again.
Much alarmed, she now ran out and told her mother,
who said she must have fancied it, or else that she must
be ill. She said that she was quite well and that she was
sure she had seen the animal. Then her mother promised
to wait outside the door, and if the dog appeared again
her daughter said she would call her. Presently the
daughter saw the dog again, but he disappeared when
she called her mother. Soon afterwards the mother was
taken ill and died. Before her death she said to her
daughter, "Remember the black dog."</p>

<p>Another family in the east of England has a tradition
that the appearance of a black dog portends the death
of one of its members. It was not said that no death
took place without such warning; but only that, when
the apparition occurred, its meaning was certain. The
eldest son of this family married. He knew not whether
to believe or disbelieve the legend. On one hand he
thought it superstitious to receive it, and, on the other,
he could not altogether reject it in the face of much
testimony. In this state of doubt&mdash;the thing itself being
unpleasant&mdash;he resolved to say nothing on the subject
to his young wife. It could only, he thought, worry and
harass her, and could not by any possibility do any good,
and he kept this resolution. In due course of time he
had a family; but of the apparition he saw nothing. At
length, one of his children was taken ill with small-pox;
but the attack was slight and not the least danger was
apprehended. He was sitting down to dinner with his
wife, when she said, "I will just step upstairs and see
how baby is going on, and I will be back again in a
moment." She went and, returning rather hastily, said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
"Baby is asleep; but pray go upstairs, for there is a
large black dog lying on his bed. Go up and drive it out
of the house." The father had no doubt of the result.
He went upstairs; there was no black dog to be seen;
but the child was dead.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The New Hall at Nafferton was the occasional residence
of the Derwentwater (Radcliffe) family, who left it for
Dilston Hall in 1768. Gradually the place fell into decay
and strange things were seen about the house. The
apparitions were most frequent at times of birth or death,
or as preliminaries to any fatal accident, and they took
the forms of a white weasel, a white hen, or a white
rabbit, and sometimes a headless person dressed in white.
Rappings and other noises were frequent, and became so
obtrusive that finally a farmer who lived in the house
decided to investigate matters. He called his brother
to help him, and as the worst noises came from a cavity
in his own room, covered by a hearthstone and called
the "Priest's Hole," they began by digging up the
hearthstone. Beneath it was an accumulation of rubbish,
which they emptied out until they found a flagged recess,
surrounded at the sides by a stone seat, the actual hiding-place
of priests, usual in the houses of gentry of Roman
Catholic tenets. Seeing nothing extraordinary, they were
about to desist from their labours when they thought
they heard a voice urging them to go on digging. From
the "priest's hole" they entered another apartment, and
then a third, where they found a blood-stained shirt
and nightcap, which were apparently of new linen, but
as soon as they were exposed to the atmosphere they
crumbled away like "burnt tinder."</p>

<p>On careful inquiry it was discovered that about the
time of the Radcliffes' occupancy, an old pedlar had been
murdered on the spot and his goods stolen by the innkeeper's
daughters.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Albert Smith, whose brother was a pupil at Guildford
Grammar School, tells a story of a phantom vision which
appeared at the time of a death. Several of the schoolboys
had been sitting up all night for a frolic when one
of them said, "I'll swear there's a likeness of our old
huntsman on his grey horse going across the whitewashed
wall!" He was laughed at for being so superstitious,
but next morning a servant came from the family to say
"the old huntsman had been thrown from his horse
and killed that morning whilst airing the hounds."</p>

<p>It is no easier to attempt to explain such an apparition
than it is to say why Jemmy Lowther, the "bad Lord
Lonsdale," was said to dash about in his phantom coach
and six after his death.</p>

<p>Another member of a noble family was responsible for
bringing trouble on his house through his wicked
ways.</p>

<p>The Lambtons were haunted for nine generations by
a horrible snake or worm which brought much evil in
its train. One day the heir to the estate, a ne'er-do-well,
was fishing in the Wear on a Sunday and catching nothing
he vented his anger in loud curses. Soon afterwards
there were indications that a fish was on his line, and,
to his disgust, he found he had hooked a monster, something
between a worm and a serpent. Terrified, he
threw the creature into a well close by. Before long,
repenting of his wicked ways, he betook himself to the
Crusades, leaving his aged father to look after the estates
without him. Meanwhile the monster he had caught
grew too large for the well and crawled forth to work ill
to the country-side, laying waste the land, devouring
cattle, and plundering right and left. The villagers tried
to appease it by offerings of milk, but no real release was
to be had from this serpent-tyrant until the return of
the young heir from the Crusade. Then he battled with
the monster for freedom, much in the manner of St.
George and the Dragon, except that he took a vow to
offer as a sacrifice the first living thing he met after his
victory was won. To his horror this happened to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
his father, and incapable of parricide, he preferred to
allow a curse to descend on posterity, and for nine generations
the Lambtons died by violence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But no Christian might his father slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No penance the deed atone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no Lambton for nine ages past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die in his bed was known.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another story tells of what happened to a noble dame
when she died, after having lived an evil life.</p>

<p>Lady Howard in the time of James I was said to be
the possessor of evil qualities in spite of her beauty and
accomplishments. She was cruel to her only daughter,
and was thought to get rid of her husbands by mysterious
means, for she had been married four times.</p>

<p>When she died she had to do penance for her sins.
Being transformed into a hound, she was compelled to
run a long distance every night from her residence at
Fitzford, to Okehampton Park and back to her old home,
carrying a blade of grass picked from the park. This
work was to go on until all the grass had been removed
from Okehampton.</p>

<p>That evil-doing is punishable by a descent in the scale
of being is a salient point which appears in the race-beliefs
of many nations.</p>

<p>The Lady Sybil of Bernshaw Tower, a fair maid of
high rank but evil repute, turned into a white doe after
making a strange compact with the devil. Rich, young,
and beautiful, her desires were still unsatisfied and she
longed for supernatural powers, so that she might take
part in the witches' Sabbath. At this time, Lord William
of Hapton Tower (a member of the Townley family)
was a suitor for Lady Sybil's hand, but his proposals did
not meet with her approval. In despair, he decided to
consult a famous Lancashire witch called Mother Helston,
who promised him success on All Halloween. In accordance
with her instructions he went hunting and at a
short distance from the Eagle's Crag a milk-white doe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
started from behind the thicket, and he found it impossible
to capture the animal. His hounds were wearied
and he returned to the Crag, almost determined to give
up the chase, when a strange hound joined his pack.
Then a fresh start was made, and the strange hound,
Mother Helston's familiar, captured the white doe.
That night an earthquake shook Hapton Tower to its
foundations and in the morning the white doe appeared
as the fair Lady Sybil, who had been fleeing from her
suitor in animal shape. Thus Lord William married the
heiress of Bernshaw Tower, but a year later she renewed
her diabolical practices and not until she lay near death
was it possible for Lord William to have the devil's bond
cancelled, which he did by enlisting the holy offices of
a neighbouring priest. After her death Bernshaw Tower
was deserted and tradition says that on All Halloween,
the hound and the milk-white doe meet on the Eagle's
Crag, where Lady Sybil lies buried, and are pursued by
a spectre huntsman in full chase.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the ghost of a human being has the power
of taking animal shape, as in the case of the eccentric
Miss Beswick of Birchen Bower, Hollinwood.</p>

<p>Birchen Bower was a quaint four-gabled mansion built
in the form of a cross, and attached to it was a large barn,
where many uncanny incidents happened.</p>

<p>"On the 22nd of July," says the "Manchester
Guardian" of August 15, 1868, "the remains of Miss
Beswick were committed to the earth in the Harpurhey
Cemetery. There is a tradition that this lady, who is
supposed to have died about one hundred years ago, had
acquired so strong a fear of being buried alive that she
left certain property to her medical attendant, so long
as her body should be kept above ground. The doctor
seems to have embalmed her body with tar, and then
swathed it with a strong bandage, leaving the face exposed,
and to have kept 'her' out of the grave as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
he could. For many years past the mummy has been
lodged in the rooms of the Manchester Natural History
Society (Peter Street), where it has been an object of
much popular interest. It seems that the commissioners,
who are charged with the rearrangement of the Society's
collections, have deemed this specimen undesirable, and
have at last buried it."</p>

<p>A curious bargain appears to have been made by Miss
Beswick, namely, that every twenty-one years her body
was to be taken back to Birchen Bower and be left there
for one week, and the more elderly inhabitants declared
that this was done at the stated times, and the body laid
in the granary of the old farmstead. On the morning
when the corpse was fetched away, the horses and cows
were invariably found to have been let loose, and sometimes
a cow would be found up in the hayloft, although
how it came there was a mystery, as there was no passage
large enough to admit the animal. The last prank of
this description played by Miss Beswick, as far as information
goes, was a few years ago when a cow belonging to
the farmer then tenanting the place was found in the
hayloft. Naturally enough the neighbours believed that
supernatural agency had been employed to place it there.
This occurred at the fourteenth anniversary of seven
years after Miss Beswick died, and it was a recognised
fact that some apparition was usually seen at Birchen
Bower at the expiration of every seven years. No one
could explain how the cow could get into the loft, and
blocks had to be borrowed from Bower Mill to get
her down again through the hay-hole outside the
barn.</p>

<p>After Miss Beswick's death her house was divided up
into several cottages, and she seems to have haunted the
spot. To one family she appeared as an old lady in a
silken gown, and her arrival was invariably announced to
them as they were seated at supper by a rustling of silk
which was heard at the entrance. Soon after the lady,
arrayed in black silk, glided into the room, walked straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
into the parlour and disappeared at one particular flagstone.
As she annoyed no one her appearance never
drew forth any further remark than "Hush! Here's the
old lady again."</p>

<p>Tradition said that Miss Beswick had hidden vast
sums of money and other articles of value in the time
of Prince Charlie (1745), and a weaver who lived in a
part of the haunted house found a tin vessel full of gold
pieces under the floor of the haunted parlour. It was
thought after this discovery that the phantom lady
would rest in her grave, but this was not the case, and she
recently appeared near an old well by the brook-side. A
rustic going to fetch water, saw a tall lady standing by
the well, wearing a black silk gown and a white cap with
a frilled border. She stood there in the dusk in a defiant
or threatening attitude, streams of blue light appearing
to dart from her eyes and flash on the horror-stricken
spectator. This appearance of the phantom was said to
mean that Miss Beswick could get no rest until certain
members of her family regained their property, a result
which does not appear to be yet achieved, for the
phantom still haunts the neighbourhood, on clear moonlight
nights, walking in a headless state between the old
barn and the horse-pool, and at other times assuming the
forms of different animals which, however, are always
lost sight of near the horse-pool. Some people think that
Miss Beswick concealed something on this spot in 1745,
and is now anxious to point out her treasure to anyone
brave enough to address her. On dreary winter nights
the barn where the phantom cow was found is said to
appear as though on fire, a red glow being observed
through the loopholes and crevices of the loft, and loud
noises proceeding from the building as though the evil
one and his demons were holding revels there. But if
an alarm of fire is raised by a frightened neighbour and
the farmer has the premises searched, all is found to be
in order, and the terror-stricken inhabitants of the
village declare that Madame Beswick is up to her ghostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
pranks again.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The popular belief in transformation is at the root of
a strange family story about Callaly Castle, which is
beautifully situated at the foot of the wooded slopes of
Callaly Castle Hill, whose highest peaks are some 800 feet
above sea level. In the modern building are incorporated
the remains of an ancient border tower, the stronghold
of the Claverings. The Survey of 1541 says, "At
Callalye ys a toure of th'inheritaunce of Claverynge in
measurable good repac'ons."</p>

<p>This was probably the tower which owed its erection
on its present site&mdash;the "Shepherd's Shaw," to a difference
in opinion between the Lord and Lady of Callaly
in olden days.</p>

<p>The following account of the legend was given by
Mr. George Tate, <span class="smcap">F.G.S.</span>, in an article on "Whittingham
Vale," contributed to the "Alnwick Mercury," in 1862:
"A lord of Callaly in the days of yore, commenced
erecting a castle on the hill: his lady preferred a low,
sheltering situation in the vale. She remonstrated, but
her lord was wilful, and the building continued to progress.
What she could not obtain by persuasion she
sought to achieve by stratagem, and availed herself of
the superstitious opinions of the age. One of her servants
who was devoted to her interests, entered into her
scheme: he was dressed up like a boar, and nightly he
ascended the hill and pulled down all that had been built
during the day. It was soon whispered that the spiritual
powers were opposed to the erection of a castle on the
hill; the lord himself became alarmed, and he sent some
of his retainers to watch the building during the night
and discover the cause of the destruction. Under the
influence of the superstitions of the times those retainers
magnified appearances, and when the boar issued from
the wood and commenced overthrowing the work of the
day, they beheld a monstrous animal of enormous power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Their terror was complete when the boar, standing
among the overturned stones, cried out in a loud voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Callaly Castle built on the height,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Up in the day and down in the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Builded down in the Shepherd's Shaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It shall stand for aye and never fa'."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They immediately fled and informed the lord of the
supernatural visitation; and, regarding the rhymes as
an expression of the will of Heaven, he abandoned the
work, and, in accordance with the wish of his lady, built
his castle low down in the vale where the modern
mansion now stands."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The animal connected with the Coneely family is a
seal. In the west of Ireland there is a seal-clan; the clansman,
calling himself after the seal, conceives himself to
be of the blood of the eponym animal. In very ancient
times some of the Coneely clan were changed by "art
magick" into seals and since then no member of the family
can kill a seal without incurring bad luck. Seals are
called Coneelys, and on this account it was said that
many branches of the family changed their name to
Conolly.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The story was so thoroughly believed that it
was said that people who knew of it would "no more kill
a seal, or eat of a slaughtered one than they would of a
human Coneely."</p>

<p>In the Faroe Isles the seals are said to appear once a
year in human form, and in 1872 a writer to the journal
of the Anthropological Institute tells the story of an Irish
girl who was transformed into a seal.</p>

<p>"The seals which abound on the rocky parts of the
shore," he explains, "are regarded with profound veneration,
and on no account could a native be induced to
kill one, as they are said to be the souls of their departed
friends. In the hut of the king is the skin of a large white
seal, which I ascertained was piously treasured on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of having formerly been occupied by the soul of a maiden.
The following is the legend related to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Many years ago a beautiful young girl lived upon
the island and was the betrothed of a "dacent boy" by
the name of Rooney. One day Rooney and his bride-elect
were fishing out in a coracle, when a storm arose
and the frail craft capsized. The terrified lover endeavoured
in vain to save his sweetheart. Before sinking
for the last time she said farewell to him, and said she
would become a white seal and would sing to him. The
broken-hearted Rooney swam ashore, but his reason had
fled. He daily made a pilgrimage round the island in
the hope of meeting his departed in the shape of a white
seal; but his journeys were always fruitless.</p>

<p>"'At length one stormy winter night, Rooney started
from his couch saying, "Hark, I hear her singing. She
calls me now," and before anyone could stop him, he
had bounded off and was lost in the darkness. His
friends were about to follow when they were deterred by
a plaintive voice, chanting a melancholy lay, but when
daylight broke it ceased. Then a search was made and
down on the seashore they found the dead body of
Rooney with a dead white seal clasped to his breast.'"
The souls of the lovers had fled to an enchanted island.</p>

<p>Siward in the legend was the son of a bear and had
bear's ears. Brochmail was a tusked king of Powis. A
tusked or pig-headed birth is said to appear periodically
in the Powis family, and there was a story of one member
who was so repulsive to the sight that he was kept shut
up in the oubliette of Powis Castle.</p>

<p>In Llayn (Carnarvonshire) it is said that March
Amheirchion, the Lord of Castell March, had horse's ears,
as in the Irish story. These instances are again related
to the birth of monsters and deformities, like the Concheannaich
or Dogheads, an ancient race who inhabited,
in former days, the district now called Moygoniby in
Kervy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>Conaire the Great, a mythical king of Ireland, was the
son of a Bird King and was therefore forbidden to kill
any feathered creatures.</p>

<p>In Scotland the clan Chattan, who gave their name to
Caithness, called their Chieftain Mohr an Chat, the
Great Wild Cat, probably owing to some physical
peculiarity.</p>

<p>Cuchullaine, the "hound of Culain," is a totem name.
There is a story of a witch who offered one of the family
some cooked dog-flesh to eat, but he refused it as it was
against the law that he should "eat his namesake's-flesh."</p>

<p>His name was originally Setanta, but his nickname was
obtained in this way: One night when he followed
Conchobar to the house of Culain, a smith, the gates
were locked, and a ferocious dog lay in watch. The boy
killed the hound, and when the smith lamented his loss,
Setanta said, "I will be your <i>cu</i> (dog) until another is
grown large enough to guard your house," whence he
was called hound of Culain or Cuchullaine.</p>

<p>According to one account Cuchullaine has more
affinity with a bird than with a dog. "Not only does
Cuchullaine bear obvious in his name his origin as a
cuckoo god but his birth, exploits, and death are those of
a cuckoo."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>When he was going forth to his last fight he met
three crones, daughters of the mist, who asked him to
sup with them. Bent on his destruction, they were
cooking a hound with poison and spells on spits of the
rowan tree. He refused to partake of the dish because
it was against the law, and they rebuked him, saying, "It
is because the food is only a hound and so you despise it
and us." His chivalry thus appealed to, Cuchullaine
helped himself to a shoulder-blade out of the stew, and
held it in his left hand while he was eating, putting it,
when finished, under his left thigh. Then his left hand
and thigh became stricken and he had no strength for
the fight.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<br />
ANIMAL GHOSTS</h3>


<p>For a ghost to take the form of an animal is not at all
unusual, and it has been suggested that human ghosts
when they appear in the guise of bulls, dogs, sheep, or
other animals are accounted for by being "throw-backs
of the spirit to a lower animal form."</p>

<p>Black dogs with glowing eyes like hot embers, phantom
calves, white rabbits, etc., are sometimes thought in
Lincolnshire to haunt the spots where murder or suicide
has been committed. They are supposed to be either
spectres of the dead in brute form or demons, and in
Denmark there is a legend that pigs or goats, if buried
alive in walls, turn to spectres.</p>

<p>In Wales the belief exists that the devil can manifest
as a pig, calf, dog, or headless horse.</p>

<p>A woman once passing through a village in North
Pembrokeshire at night shouted, "Come out, you evil
one!" and there appeared a white cat in answer to her
call. In the same country a certain Mr. David Walter
was passing two large stones called locally the Devil's
Nags, accompanied by a mastiff, when an apparition in
the form of a huge dog appeared in his path. He tried
to set his own animal upon the other, but the mastiff
was frightened and would not attack the phantom.
Thereupon Walter picked up a stone and was about to
throw it at the evil beast when it was suddenly illumined
by a circle of fire, and he knew it to be one of the "infernal
dogs of hell."</p>

<p>A black calf was said to haunt a stream in the same
neighbourhood and one night two villagers caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
animal and took it home. They locked it up safely as
they thought, but in the morning it had disappeared.</p>

<p>The Roaring Bull of Bagbury is a famous Shropshire
ghost. Miss Georgina Jackson recites the story as it was
told by an old farmer called Hayward.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>A very bad man lived at Bagbury Farm, and when he
died it was said of him that he had only done two good
deeds in his life, one being to give a waistcoat to a poor
old man and the other a piece of bread and cheese to a
poor village lad. After he was dead, his ghost refused to
rest and haunted the farm buildings in the shape of a bull,
roaring till the boards, the shutters, and the tiles seemed
about to fly off the outhouses. It was quite impossible
for anyone to live within range of this roaring which
usually began about nine or ten o'clock at night, sometimes
even earlier, and at last became so troublesome
that the people at the farmhouse sent for twelve parsons
to lay the ghost.</p>

<p>When the parsons came "they got him under," but
could not lay him, and at last they drove him, still in the
shape of a bull, into Hessington Church. All the parsons
carried candles, and one of them, who was blind, knowing
that there was danger from a stampede, placed his
lighted candle in his top-boot. It was a good thing that
he did so, for presently the animal made a great rush,
and out went every candle except that belonging to the
blind parson who said, as though prepared for the event,
"You light your candles by mine." But before he was
laid the bull made such a "burst" that he cracked the
wall of the church from top to bottom, as hundreds of
witnesses have asserted from that day to this.</p>

<p>At last they secured the ghost "down into a snuffbox,"
as the custom is, and he begged that he might be
laid under Bagbury Bridge, declaring that every mare
that passed over the bridge should lose her foal and every
woman her child. This threat made them refuse his
request, and they laid him in the Red Sea, where he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to remain for a thousand years. The knowledge that he
was so far away did not prevent the villagers being very
chary of crossing Bagbury Bridge at night-time.</p>

<p>Another story of a man who turned into a bull after
death is told of a squire at Millidrope in Corve Dale.
He was killed by a fall from one of the upper windows of
the Hall, and an indelible blood-stain marks the spot.
Unfortunately for his peace of mind, his estate, owing
to his own carelessness or to the malpractices of his
trustees, went to the wrong heir. Unable to rest in his
grave owing to this piece of injustice, the squire haunted
his own parish, where he was frequently seen in the guise
of a <i>flayed bull</i>.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Edmund Swifte tells a story of an animal ghost in
the Tower, which appeared while he was keeper of the
Crown Jewels. The peculiar point about the story is
that this phantom animal was seen with fatal results.
One of the night sentries in the Jewel chamber was
alarmed by a figure like a huge bear issuing from beneath
the door. He thrust at it with his bayonet, which stuck
in the door. Then he fell into a fit and was carried senseless
to the guard-room. His fellow sentry declared that
the man was neither asleep nor drunk, he himself having
seen him the moment before awake and sober. Swifte
saw the man in the guard-house after the incident, when
he lay prostrated with terror, and two or three days later
the poor sentry was dead.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>In the outer Hebrides it is believed that demons take
the form of dogs, and a story is told of a priest's dog
which was lying on the hearth while his master was hearing
confessions. Suddenly the animal started up, annoyed
beyond endurance by the atmosphere of ultra-piety and,
exclaiming, "If you liked me before, you never will
again," he vanished amidst a shower of sparks.</p>

<p>The Highlanders have also a legend of an ownerless
black dog, which caused all kinds of misadventure in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
vicinity where he prowled. A hunter shot at the dog
with a silver bit, and the aim was so successful that
nothing more was seen of the animal. Suddenly a small
boy ran up to the hunter with a terrible story of his
grandfather who had died within sight of his home as
though stricken by a gun-shot wound, and on examination
it was found indeed that the silver piece was imbedded
in his flesh. There was no further misfortune
in the village after this double event, but the tale has
more of witchcraft about it than ghostliness.</p>

<p>Samuel Drew, who was apprenticed to a shoemaker,
had a curious experience at St. Blazey in Cornwall. It
is told in his life written by his son.</p>

<p>"There were several of us boys and men, out about
twelve o'clock on a bright moonlight night. I think we
were poaching. The party were in a field adjoining the
road leading from my master's to St. Austell, and I was
stationed outside the hedge to watch and give the alarm
if any intruder should appear. While thus occupied I
heard what appeared to be the sound of a horse approaching
from the town, and I gave a signal. My companions
paused and came to the hedge where I was, to see the
passenger. They looked through the bushes and I drew
myself close to the hedge that I might not be observed.
The sound increased, and the supposed horseman seemed
drawing near. The clatter of hoofs became more and
more distinct. We all looked to see what it was, and
I was seized with a strange indefinable feeling of dread:
when, instead of a horse, there appeared coming towards
us, at an easy pace, but with the same sound which first
caught my ear, a creature about the height of a large
dog. It went close by me, and as it passed, it turned upon
me and my companions huge fiery eyes that struck terror
to all our hearts. The road where I stood branched off
and on the left there was a gate. Towards the gate the
phantom moved, and without any apparent obstruction,
went at its regular trot, which we heard several minutes
after it had disappeared. Whatever it was, it put an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
end to our occupation and we made the best of our way
home.</p>

<p>"I have often endeavoured in later years, but without
success, to account for what I then heard and saw on
natural principles. I am sure there was no deception as
to the facts. It was a night of unusual brightness, occasioned
by a cloudless full moon. The creature was unlike
any animal I had then seen, but from my present recollections
it had much the appearance of a bear, with a
dark shaggy coat. Had it not been for the unearthly
lustre of its eyes, and its passing through the gate as it
did, there would be no reason to suppose it anything
more than an animal perhaps escaped from some menagerie.
That it <i>did</i> pass through the gate without pause
or hesitation I am perfectly clear. Indeed we all saw it,
and saw that the gate was shut, from which we were not
distant more than about twenty or thirty yards. The
bars were too close to admit the passage of an animal of
half its apparent bulk, yet this creature went through
without an effort or variation of its pace."</p>

<p>Peele Castle in the Isle of Man is haunted by an apparition
called the Manx dog, a shaggy spaniel, which was
said to walk in every part of the building, and to lie in
the guard-chamber before the fire by candlelight. In
days gone by the soldiers were accustomed to the apparition,
but all the same they suspected it was an evil spirit,
and all were afraid to be left alone in its presence, and
were also careful of the language they used lest they
should receive an injury if they swore before it. The
animal used to appear and return by a passage in the
church, and as this passage was also used by the soldier
who had to deliver the keys to the captain, and he was
terrified at the thought of meeting the phantom, it
was arranged that he should have a companion, and after
that they went two by two, never singly.</p>

<p>One night one of the soldiers who had been drinking
and was in a bragging mood, declared that he would
carry back the key alone, though it was not really his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
turn to go. He would not listen to the others, who tried
to dissuade him. Blustering and swearing, he snatched
up the bunch of keys and marched off. Presently a great
noise was heard outside, but the soldiers were too
frightened to go out and see what was taking place.
In staggered the adventurous boaster, struck dumb with
horror at what he had seen, nor could he by sign or word
explain what had happened to him, but died, in terrible
agony, his features distorted and his limbs writhing.</p>

<p>After this occurrence no one would venture through
the passage, which was soon bricked up, and the apparition
never appeared again in the castle.</p>

<p>Hergest Court, in Herefordshire, was haunted by a
demon dog said to have belonged to Black Vaughan.
Black Vaughan was himself said to be the ghost of the
member of the family whose monument rests in Kingston
Church. So powerful was this ghost that he appeared in
daylight and upset farmers' waggons, or rode with the
old wives to Kingston Market. Once he was said to have
appeared in church in the form of a bull, and the usual
elaborate form of exorcism was required to dislodge him,
in which twelve parsons with twelve candles had to remain
in the church until they had "read him down into a
silver snuff-box." The demon dog always appeared as a
warning that death was nigh to one of the Vaughan
family.</p>

<p>The Black Dog of Hergest was famous all over the
country-side, and no one ventured to enter the room he
was said to haunt. At night he clanked a chain, but at
other times he was seen wandering about without one,
often near a pond on the high road to Kingston.</p>

<p>Another phantom dog-story comes from the parish of
Dean Prior, a narrow woodland valley watered by a
stream. Below a beautiful cascade is a deep hollow called
the Hound's Pool. At one time there lived near to this
spot a skilful weaver. After his death he was seen by
his family working as diligently as ever at his loom, and,
this being regarded as uncanny, application was made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
the vicar of the parish as to what steps were to be taken
to remove the apparition. The parson called at the
cottage where the weaver had lived and, hearing the
noise of the shuttle in the upstairs room, called to the
ghost of the weaver to descend.</p>

<p>"I will," replied the weaver's voice, "as soon as I
have worked out my shuttle."</p>

<p>"No," replied the vicar, "you have worked long
enough. Come down at once."</p>

<p>So the phantom appeared, and the vicar, taking a
handful of earth from the churchyard, threw it in his
face. In a moment the apparition turned into a black
hound. "Follow me," said the vicar, and the dog
followed to the gate of the wood, where a mighty wind
was blowing. The vicar picked up a nutshell with a hole
in it and leading the hound to the pool below the cascade,
said, "Take this, and dip out the pool with it. When it
is empty thou shalt rest."</p>

<p>The hound still haunts the spot, and to those who can
see is ever at work on the waters of the pool.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Similarly Tregeagle, the famous Demon of Dosmery
Pool, in Cornwall, is doomed to empty the pool with a
limpet shell which has a large hole in it.</p>

<p>A story is told of a talking Dog which haunted Dobb
Park Lodge.</p>

<p>A treasure-seeker who went to explore the underground
vaults at the Lodge saw a great, black, rough
dog as large as any two or three mastiffs, which said, "No,
my man, as you've come here, you must do one of three
things, or you'll never see daylight again. You must
either drink all the liquor there is in that glass, open
that chest, or draw that sword."</p>

<p>The chest was iron-bound and too heavy to move,
the drink was scalding hot, and the sword glittered and
flashed like lightning wielded by an unseen hand. Fortunately
the treasure-seeker escaped after extraordinary
experiences with his bare life, returning as empty-handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
as he came, and since then no one has ventured into the
ruined vaults of Dobb Park Lodge, and the chest of gold
is said to be still there, waiting for an adventurer who can
brave the terrors of the "Talking Dog" and his surroundings.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Burnley used to be haunted by
a phantom locally called "Trash" or "Striker." These
names came from the sounds made by the animal which
had the appearance of a large dog with broad feet, shaggy
hair, drooping ears and "eyes as large as saucers." His
paws made a splashing noise as of old shoes on a muddy
road, and now and again the brute emitted deep howls.
His presence was considered a certain sign of death in
the family of anyone who caught sight of the apparition.
If followed by anyone the animal began to walk backwards,
keeping his eyes on the pursuer. At the slightest
inattention on the part of his companion the phantom
vanished. Sometimes he plunged into a pool of water,
at others he dropped at the feet of the pursuer with a
curious splashing sound. Some attempted to strike the
animal, but there was no substance present to receive
the blow, though the apparition remained in the same
position as before the blow was delivered.</p>

<p>Some animal ghosts appear in different shapes at
different times.</p>

<p>The Manor of Woodstock was haunted in 1649 by an
apparition described by several witnesses whose narratives
may be found in Dr. Plott's "Natural History of
Oxfordshire."</p>

<p>Commissioners took up residence at the Manor House
on 13 October, 1649, but heard nothing of the ghost
until three days later when "there came, as they thought,
<i>somewhat</i> into the bedchamber (where two of the commissioners
and their servants lay), in the shape of a dog,
which, going under their beds, did as it were gnaw their
bed cords, but on the morrow finding them whole and a
quarter of beef, which lay on the ground, untouched
they began to entertain other thoughts." On the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
day, the 17th, some evil spirit hurled the chairs and
stools up and down the Presence Chamber, "from
whence it came into the two chambers where the commissioners
and their servants lay and hoisted their beds'
feet so much higher than their heads that they thought
they should have been turned over and over; and then
let them fall down with such force, that their bodies
rebounded from the bed a good distance."</p>

<p>The next day also a mysterious visitor appeared to be
present, which fetched the warming-pan out of the withdrawing-room
and made so much noise "that they
thought five bells could not have made more." On the
20th and 21st of October various phenomena occurred,
and then came a respite until the 25th, on the night of
which, amongst other curious sounds and sights, there
was "a very great noise as if forty pieces of ordnance
had been shot off together." Peace was restored until
the 1st of November when "something came into the
withdrawing-room, treading, as they conceived, much
like a bear, which at first only walked about a quarter of
an hour: at length it made a great noise about the
table and threw the warming-pan so violently, that it
quite spoiled it. It threw also glass and great stones at
them again, and the bones of horses, and all so violently
that the bedstead and walls were bruised by them."
This night they set candles all about the rooms, and made
great fires up to the mantle-trees of the chimneys, but
all were put out, nobody knew how. Nor was this all.
For in spite of the fact that one of the commissioners had
the boldness to ask in the name of God what <i>it</i> was,
what <i>it</i> would have, and what they had done, that they
should be disturbed in this manner, and the questions,
although evoking no answer, caused a temporary cessation
of noise, <i>it</i> returned bringing seven devils worse
than <i>itself</i>. Whereupon one of the watchers lighted a
candle and set it between two rooms in the doorway, on
which another of them "fixing his eyes saw the similitude
of a hoof, striking the candle and candlestick into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
middle of the bedchamber and afterwards making three
scrapes on the snuff to put it out. Upon this the same
person was so bold as to draw his sword, but he had scarce
got it out, when there was another invisible hand had
hold of it too, and tugged with him for it and prevailing,
struck him so violently with the pummel that he was
stunned with the blow."</p>

<p>This was too much, and two days later the commissioners
and their men removed out of the house,
unable to stand the strain they were undergoing any
longer.</p>

<p>An apparition of a lady in the form of a colt is somewhat
unusual, but has been seen, if we may believe the
statement of a woman called Sarah Mason. Sarah also
saw the ghost of a man who hanged himself and came
back afterwards in the form of a large black dog.</p>

<p>The story of Obrick's Colt<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> concerned a lady who was
buried with all her jewels and whose corpse was afterwards
robbed by the clerk. She haunted the spot, it was said,
in the shape of a colt, and the guilty clerk, meeting the
phantom animal late one night in a narrow lane, went
down on his knees, and said earnestly, "Abide, Satan,
abide. I am a righteous man and a psalm-singer." The
clerk was called Obitch or Holbeach, from which the
ghost is supposed to have taken the name of Obrick's
Colt. An old woman in the village declared that "Obitch
used to say that he saw the colt as natural as any Christian,
and he used to get up against the stile for him to get up
on top of his back, and at last the colt grew so bold that
folks saw him in the daytime." Holbeach, if that was his
real name, never again knew peace of mind on this earth.</p>

<p>On the 21st of January, 1879, a labourer had taken
some luggage from one Shropshire village to another,
and on the return journey, his horse being tired, he
reached a canal bridge some way from home about ten
o'clock at night. To his horror a huge black creature
with gleaming white eyes jumped out of the hedge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
settled on the horse's back. He beat at the phantom
with his whip, which, to his astonishment, instead of
meeting with resistance went through the apparition.
The terrified horse broke into a canter and tore home
with the strange creature clinging to his back.</p>

<p>The adventure was much discussed in the neighbouring
villages, and some days later the labourer's master was
called upon by a policeman who had somehow got knowledge
of an account that he had been robbed when crossing
the canal bridge in question late one evening.
The policeman was told there had been no robbery,
and a version of the tale as it had happened was given
him.</p>

<p>"Was that all?" he cried in disappointed tones. "I
know what that was. It was the man-monkey, sir, as
<i>does</i> come at that bridge ever since a man was drowned
in the canal at that spot."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The following story was told to Bérenger-Feraud<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and
happened at a country house on the plateau of the Garde
near to Toulon. One evening a woman was sitting by
the side of her father who had been lying dangerously
ill in bed for some days with a disease which the doctors
could not identify. The neighbours came in to offer
their services, to keep watch over the sick man so that
his daughter, who had spent several nights without any
sleep, could go and lie down to rest. She thanked them
but refused to do so.</p>

<p>Nevertheless they insisted on remaining, and as it
was cold she invited them to sit round the fire in the
kitchen to warm themselves. As her father seemed to
be asleep for a little while she went into the kitchen to
speak to her visitors.</p>

<p>Of a sudden they heard the sick man give a terrible
cry of pain and fright. They all hurried into his room
to see what was the matter, and there, just above the
old man's bed, was a huge stinging-fly which hovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
round and round him, buzzing in a horrible manner.</p>

<p>They tried to catch the dangerous insect, but this was
not an easy matter, for it buzzed so loudly that it positively
menaced those who came near it. From time to
time it hurled itself at the limbs of the sick man, and
every time it touched him he gave vent to a shriek of
pain. Those who were near him could see large black
blisters rising at the spots where the stinging-fly attacked
him.</p>

<p>At last one of the men who had more courage than the
others beat down the gigantic insect with his hat. They
picked up its body with a pair of tongs and threw it out
of the house, shutting the door tightly so that it could not
return to its attack.</p>

<p>The deed accomplished, they looked at one another
terrified at what had taken place, and to their horror
they could plainly hear the buzz of the insect outside.
The noise was so loud that the windows positively rattled.
Then a howl arose outside, a cry so strange that no one
present had ever heard the like, and after that all was
silent.</p>

<p>They went back to the bedside of the sick man, who
had suffered severely, and who told them that he had
been suddenly awakened by this horrible stinging-fly,
which had hummed in his ears and struck at his body, in
such a terrifying manner that he felt sure it must be an
evil spirit.</p>

<p>Now that the insect had been captured and put out
of the house he felt better, but none of the visitors
dared to leave the cottage, feeling sure that a sorcerer was
mixed up in the affair. They passed the night sitting
round the fire, carefully avoiding all mention of the
matter, as they were afraid that the noise of buzzing
and humming would begin afresh.</p>

<p>The next morning at sunrise, they decided to open
the door, and then they saw the huge insect lying on the
ground just outside. But the mysterious part of it was
that those who were courageous enough to look at it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
closely, stated that it was not the real insect that was
lying there but merely its outer shell or covering, just
like the skin sloughed by a grasshopper and left behind
when it changes its shape.</p>

<p>This then was taken to be proof positive that the stinging-fly
was not what it had pretended to be, but was a
wizard in disguise, which had intended to do harm to
the old invalid, and the horrible cry which had been heard
when the insect had been thrown out of doors was only
the howl of rage uttered by the wizard at the failure of
his wicked designs.</p>

<p>A woman at Toulon told the following story in 1888,
saying it had happened in her presence when she was a
little girl. Her father, whose name was Isidore, was an
omnibus driver and for many years had lived with his
own sister in peace and friendliness. One day, however,
they fell into an argument and had such a violent quarrel
that they decided that they could no longer live together.
Isidore, however, felt grieved to think that matters had
come to such a pass between himself and the sister he
had always loved, and he told a friend about the affair.
The friend answered, "You have quarrelled with your
sister, because one of your neighbours, who is a sorcerer,
has cast a spell over you. To end the enchantment you
must give your horses a jolly good hiding to-morrow
morning, and then you will see the result. The person
who has bewitched you will be taken ill and will bear
about his or her body the traces of the blows you give to
your horses." Next day Isidore whipped up his horses,
as he had been told to do, and he went on slashing them
all day long. In the evening he went to bed feeling as
though he had done a praiseworthy deed. The next
day his sister came to see him and spoke to him quite
affectionately, and they decided to bury the hatchet just
as though no quarrel had taken place. Then Isidore, to
his surprise, heard that a neighbour, of whom he had been
very fond until then, and whom he had not in the least
suspected of witchcraft, had been taken ill. He hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
to visit her, and found she was in bed, and that she showed
traces of having been beaten. As soon as he entered the
room to condole with her she said to him bitterly, "Why
on earth did you strike your horses so violently? What
harm had the poor beasts done to you?"</p>

<p>This was taken as proof that the neighbour was a
witch, and that the weals on her body were the stigmata
of the blows which Isidore had given his horses, and he
was convinced that this woman had tried to separate
him from his sister through sheer jealousy.</p>

<p>The well-known ghost of Tedworth, Wiltshire, called
the "Drummer of Tedworth," sometimes took the form
of an animal, or at least was heard making animal sounds.
The following description is taken from Joseph Glanvill's
"Sadducismus Triumphatus."</p>

<p>On one occasion the village blacksmith stayed in the
house sleeping with the footman, hoping he might hear
the supernatural noises and be cured of his incredulity
when "there came a noise in the room as if one had been
shoeing a horse, and somewhat came, as it were, with a
pair of pincers," snipping away at the sceptical smith.
Next day the ghost came panting like a dog out of breath,
and a woman who was present, taking up a stick to strike
at it, the weapon "was caught suddenly out of her
hand and thrown away: and company coming up, the
room was presently filled with a bloody noisome smell,"
and was very hot, though there was no fire, and the winter
was severe. "It continued scratching for an hour and a
half and then went into the next room, when it knocked
a little and seemed to rattle a chain."</p>

<p>Sometimes the phantom purred like a cat and it was
described by a servant as "a great body with two red
and glaring eyes."</p>

<p>The Rev. Joseph Glanvill himself went to the haunted
house in January, 1662, and was convinced that the
noises were made by a demon or spirit. He heard a
strange scratching, as he went upstairs, which appeared
to come from behind the bolster of the children's bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
It was loud scratching, and when he thrust his hand
behind the bolster at the point from which the noise
seemed to come it ceased but began in another place.
When he removed his hand, however, it began again in
the same place as before. "I had been told that it would
imitate noises," says Glanvill, "and made trial by
scratching several times upon the sheet, as five, and seven
and ten, which it followed, and still stopped at my
number. I searched under and behind the bed, turned
up the clothes to the bed cords, grasped the bolster,
sounded the wall behind, and made all the search I
possibly could." But all his endeavours were fruitless;
he could discover nothing. There was neither cat nor
dog in the room. After scratching for more than half
an hour, the phantom went into the midst of the bed,
under the children, "and then seemed to pant very
loudly, like a dog out of breath. I put my hand upon
the place and felt the bed bearing up against it, as if
something within had thrust it up." The motion it
caused by this panting was so strong that it shook the
walls and made the windows rattle; yet this strange
animal ghost was never explained.</p>

<p>At Epworth parsonage, Lincolnshire, when the Rev.
Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley, was rector, there
is a well-known story of the haunting of the parsonage.
Robert Brown the servant heard, among other phenomena,
"as it were the gobbling of a turkey-cock close
to the bedside."</p>

<p>The dog, a large mastiff, showed enormous fear of the
strange incidents and apparitions. "When the disturbances
continued he used to bark and leap and snap
on one side and the other, and that frequently before
any person in the room heard any noise at all. But after
two or three days he used to tremble and creep away
before the noise began. And by that the family knew it
was at hand."</p>

<p>Ewshott House, in Crondall, Hampshire, was haunted
by a ghost that made a noise exactly as though a flock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
sheep from the paddock had rushed by the windows on
the gravel drive. In the morning, however, there were
no signs of sheep having passed that way.</p>

<p>Willington Mill was haunted by several spectres in the
shape of animals. The mill stood on a tidal stream
which ran into the Tyne near to Wallsend. The account
of strange happenings there was published by the
"Newcastle Weekly Leader" many years ago. One of
the servants once saw a lady in a lavender-coloured dress
pass the kitchen door, go upstairs, and vanish into one of
the bedrooms, but little notice was taken of this apparition;
indeed it was almost forgotten when something
else happened which drew attention to it. A certain
Thomas Davidson was courting this servant and was
waiting for her to come out of the mill and join him in
a moonlight ramble, when, looking towards the building,
he distinctly saw a whitish cat run out and presently it
came close to his feet.</p>

<p>Thinking the strange puss was very forward, he gave
her a kick, but encountered no solid matter and puss
continued her walk, disappearing from his sight a
moment later. Returning to the window, and looking
in the same direction, Davidson again saw the animal.
This time it came hopping like a rabbit, coming quite
as close to his feet as before. He determined to have a
good rap at it, and took deliberate aim: but, as before,
his foot went through it and he felt nothing. Again he
followed it, and it disappeared at the same spot as its
predecessor. The third time he went to the window
and in a few moments it made another appearance, not
like a cat or rabbit now but as large as a sheep and brightly
luminous. On it came and Davidson stood rooted to
the spot as though paralysed, but the animal moved on
and vanished as before.</p>

<p>Mr. Proctor, who lived at the mill, on hearing Davidson's
account, said that he had seen the animal on various
occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>After this experience ghosts were frequently seen and
heard of at the mill. The noises were dreadful, sometimes
sounding like a galloping donkey, at others like
falling fire-irons. Doors creaked and sticks crackled as
though burning, and the rapping became almost incessant.
Sometimes the lavender-gowned lady appeared, and at
another time several of the inmates of the mill saw a
bald-headed old man in a flowing robe like a surplice.
Spectral animals always formed an important feature of
the haunting.</p>

<p>In November, 1841, a gentleman paid a visit to the
place and was confronted by the figure of an animal
about two feet high, which appeared in a window. After
careful search nothing was found, though the animal was
seen in the window by others from the grounds for half
an hour, after which it slowly faded away. A two-year-old
child saw a ghost kitten, while Davidson's aunt
thought the spectre looked like a white pocket handkerchief,
knotted at four corners, which danced up and
down, leaping as high as the first floor window. This
lady was one day standing by the kitchen table when she
was startled by the bark of a dog, and two paws were
laid heavily on her shoulders, so that she had to lean
against the table for support. No dog, however, was
found in the house. On several occasions the children,
though nothing had been said to them about ghosts,
found amusement in chasing up and down the stairs
some animal they described either as a "funny cat or a
bonny monkey."</p>

<p>In 1853, an attempt was made to discover the secret
of the mystery of the mill by a clairvoyante, who in her
trance distinctly saw, the "lady like a shadow, with
eyes but no sight in them," as she described her, as well
as a number of animals. When questioned about these,
she answered, "One is like a monkey and another like a
dog. Had the lady dogs and monkeys? They all go
about the house. What is that other one? It is not a
pussy, it runs very fast and gets amongst feet. It is a
rabbit but a very quick one." When asked whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
animals were real, the medium replied in her quaint
way, "We don't touch them to see, we would not like a
bite."</p>

<p>Beyond this there appears to have been no solution as
to the mystery of the haunted mill, although the medium
declared that the trouble "came from the cellar."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>A writer in "Notes and Queries,"<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> H. Wedgewood by
name, visited Mr. Proctor in 1873-4 to ask him the truth
about the Willington Mill ghost, and he told her that he
had seen a tabby cat in the furnace room. There was
nothing unusual in the animal's appearance, and it would
not have caught his attention particularly had it not
begun to move. But then instead of walking like an
ordinary cat it wriggled along like a snake. He went
close to it and followed it across the room, holding his
hand about a foot above it, until it passed straight into
the solid wall.</p>

<p>The well-known Cornish tradition says that if a young
woman dies neglected after being betrayed by her lover,
she haunts him after her death in the form of a white
hare. The false lover is continuously pursued by the
phantom. At times it may rescue him from danger, but
in the end it is the cause of his death.</p>

<p>The following story of a phantom hare pursuing a
false lover to his death is told by Robert Hunt in "Popular
Romances of the West of England."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>A young farmer settled at a fine new farmhouse and a
peasant's daughter was placed there in charge of the
dairy. The young farmer fell deeply in love with her
and she with him, and he betrayed her under a promise
of marriage, but his family refused to agree to the alliance
taking place, and provided a bride for him suitable to his
station. The dairymaid was sent away ignominiously
when it was known she was about to become a mother.
One morning the corpse of a newly-born infant was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
found in the farmer's field and the dairymaid was
accused of strangling her child, and was finally convicted
of murder and executed.</p>

<p>But ever after that day ill-fortune pursued the young
farmer who had behaved in such a cowardly way, and
though he removed to another part of the country, none
of his projects prospered. Gradually he took to drink to
drown his secret sorrows. He generally went out at dusk
and it was noticed that a white hare constantly crossed
his path. The animal was seen by many of the villagers
to dart under the hoofs of his horse, and the terrified
steed rushed madly forward whenever this phantom
appeared.</p>

<p>A day came when the young farmer was found drowned
in a pool at the bottom of a forsaken mine, and the
frightened horse was still grazing near the mouth of
the pit into which his master had fallen.</p>

<p>The woman he had betrayed and left to die a shameful
death, having assumed the shape of a white hare, had
haunted the perjured and false-hearted farmer to his
death.</p>

<p>It is said that fatal accidents in mines are often
foreshadowed by the appearance of a white hare or
rabbit. At Wheal Vor, writes Mr. Hunt, in "Popular
Romances of the West of England," it has always been
and is now believed that a white rabbit appears in one of
the engine houses when an accident may be looked for
in the mine. The men say that they have chased the
phantom animals without being able to catch them, and
on one occasion the rabbit ran into a "windbore" which
lay on the ground and escaped. Similarly in a French
mine one of the miners saw a white object run into an
iron pipe and hide there. He hastened forward and
stopped up both ends of the tube, calling to a companion
to examine the pipe. But the animal ghost had disappeared
and nothing remained to explain what had taken
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>The devil appeared in the form of a hare at the
hanging of two men on Warminster Down in 1813, it
was said. At Longbridge the devil appeared in the form
of a dog one Palm Sunday, according to the account of a
labourer, who when questioned as to how this was
proved, exclaimed, "<i>Sum'at</i> was there anyhow, and we
all fled!"</p>

<p>A farmer in South Wilts who died about 1860, threatened
to revisit his farm on a lonely moor and run about
in the shape of a rat. The story does not say what he
expected to gain by choosing this particular animal for
transformation purposes.</p>

<p>Superstition gives to white birds a particular power of
conveying omens.</p>

<p>A small white bird plays a part in warning an old
harper in Wales of the destruction of a prince's palace,
whither the bard had been invited to perform at festivities
held on the occasion of the birth of an heir.</p>

<p>Tradition relates that Bala Lake was formed as a
means of submerging a palace where lived a cruel and
wicked prince, who practised oppression and injustice
upon poor farmers of the district. The tyrant often
heard a ghostly voice urging him to desist from his
evil ways and saying, "Vengeance will come," but he
treated the warning with contempt.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his son's birth, there was great
rejoicing at the palace, and the poor harper was called in
to play to the guests. Mirth, wine, feasting, and dancing
continued till a late hour, and during the interval in
which the harper was allowed to rest, he retired into a
quiet corner, where, to his astonishment, he heard a
whisper in his ear, "Vengeance, vengeance!" Turning
to discover whence the sound came, he observed a tiny
white bird hovering about him, urging him, as it were,
to follow. He fell in with the creature's wishes without
stopping to fetch his harp, and the bird led him beyond
the palace walls, still singing in a plaintive note the word
"Vengeance, vengeance!" Over marshland, through
thickets, across streams and up ravines this strange pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
wandered, the bird seemingly choosing the safest path
for her companion, and growing ever more insistent in
her cries of "Vengeance, vengeance!" At last they
came to the summit of a hill some distance from the
palace. Utterly weary the harper ventured to stop and
rest, and the bird's voice was heard no more, but as he
listened he could distinguish the loud murmur of a
brook.</p>

<p>Suddenly he awoke to the fact that he had allowed
himself to be led away foolishly, and he attempted to
retrace his steps. In the dark, however, he missed his
way and was forced to await daylight. Then to his surprise
he turned his eyes upon the valley in which the
palace had stood and discovered that it was no longer
to be seen, for the waters had flooded the face of the land,
and on the placid lake that lay in the valley his harp was
floating.</p>

<p>Another story of birds that foreshadowed a calamity is
told about Yorkshire. A writer in "Notes and Queries"<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
passed through the district of Kettering on September 6,
and noticed an immense flock of birds which flew round
and round, uttering dismal cries. He spoke of the matter
to his servant, who told him the birds were called the
"Seven Whistlers," and that whenever they were heard
a great calamity might be expected. The last time he
had heard them was the night before the great Hartley
Colliery explosion. Curiously enough the writer, on
taking up the newspaper the following morning, saw
an announcement of a terrible colliery explosion at
Wigan.</p>

<p>On the Bosphorus the boatmen say, with reference to
certain flocks of birds which fly ceaselessly up and down
the channel, never resting on land or water, that they
are the souls of the damned, doomed to perpetual motion.</p>

<p>A strange bird-ghost is connected with the lake and
house of Glasfryn. On a certain evening, Grassi, which is
the phantom's name, forgot to close the well and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
waters overflowed and formed a lake. There she wanders
at night bemoaning her carelessness. She also visits the
house as a tall lady with well-marked features, large,
bright eyes and dressed all in white. Another version of
the story is that when the water overflowed and the lake
was formed, the fairies seized Grassi and changed her
into a swan and she continued to live by the waters for
more than a century and died still lamenting her lot.
Another version runs that the lady was changed into a
swan as a punishment for haunting the house.</p>

<p>Holt Castle, in Worcestershire, is said to have been
haunted by a mysterious lady in black who walked through
a passage which led to the attics, while the cellar was in
the possession of a phantom bird, not unlike a raven,
which occasionally pounced upon the servants who went
to draw beer or cider from the casks there. By flapping
his wings, the unholy bird extinguished the candle of
the adventuresome human being who invaded his domain,
and then vanished, leaving his victim prostrated with
fear.</p>

<p>York Castle was the scene in which an extraordinary
ghost took animal shape. The story is told in the
Memoirs of Sir John Reresby.</p>

<p>"One of my soldiers being on guard about eleven in
the night at the gate of Clifford Tower, the very night
after a witch had been arraigned, he heard a great noise
in the castle; and going to the porch there saw a scroll
of paper creep from under the floor, which, as he imagined
by moonshine, turned first into the shape of a
monkey, and thence assumed the form of a turkeycock,
which passed to and fro by him. Surprised at this, he
went to the prison and called the under-keeper, who
came and saw the 'scroll' dance up and down, and creep
under the door, where there was scarce an opening of
the thickness of half a crown. This extraordinary
story I had from the mouth of both one and the
other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the curiously shaped phantoms are those which
have an important part of their anatomy lacking, and
most common of all are the ghosts, human and animal,
that are seen without a head. Indeed the belief in headless
spectres, both of equine and canine beings, is remarkably
widespread throughout England.</p>

<p>The Rev. Richard Dodge, a Cornish clergyman, who
lived near Looe, was an exorcist, and was said to be able
"to drive along evil spirits of various shapes, pursuing
them with his whip." One day his services were commanded
by a Mr. Mills, Rector of Lanreath, who said
that labourers had been startled by an apparition of a
man in black garb driving a carriage drawn by headless
horses. Mr. Dodge met Mr. Mills, but as they saw no
apparition, they parted to return to their respective
homes. Mr. Dodge's horse grew restive and refused to
proceed, so he, thinking something uncanny was about
to take place, allowed the animal to return to the spot
where he had parted from Mr. Mills, whom, to his distress,
he found lying prostrate on the ground with the
spectre and his black coach and headless horses beside
him.</p>

<p>Jumping down to assist his friend, Dodge uttered a
prayer, and the spectre screaming, "Dodge is come, I
must be gone," whipped up the ghost horses and vanished
into the night.</p>

<p>Spectre horsemen are common and one is said to haunt
Wyecoller Hall. The ghost is dressed in the costume of
the Stuart period, and the trappings of the horse are of
uncouth description. On windy nights the horseman is
heard dashing up to the Hall. The rider dismounts,
makes his way up the stairs into a room on the first
landing, whence presently screams and groans issue.
Suddenly the horseman reappears and gallops off, the
horse appearing wild with rage, its nostrils streaming
fire. The tradition is that one of the Cunliffes of Billington,
for long the owners of Wyecoller Hall, near Colne,
murdered his wife and reappears every year as a spectre
horseman in the home of his victim. She is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
predicted the extinction of the family, a prediction long
since fulfilled.</p>

<p>The midnight hunter and his headless hounds are often
to be seen in Cornwall, and the Abbot's Way, on Dartmoor,
is said to be a favourite spot for their visitations.
Sir Francis Drake was supposed to drive a hearse into
Plymouth by night, followed by a pack of headless, but
nevertheless howling, hounds. On Cheney Downs in the
parish of St. Teath, ghostly hounds said to have belonged
to an old squire called Cheney, were often seen and heard,
especially in rough weather.</p>

<p>Herne, the ghostly hunter of Windsor Forest, has his
counterpart in the <i>Grand Veneur</i> of Fontainebleau.
While hunting in his favourite forest, Henry II of France
was suddenly startled by the sound of horns, and the cries
of huntsmen and the barking of dogs. At first they
sounded far away, but soon they came close by.
Some of the company in advance of the king "saw a
great black man among the bushes," crying in sepulchral
tones, "M'attendez-vous?" or "M'entendez-vous?"
or "Amendez-vous." The king, startled, inquired of
the foresters and peasants what they knew of the
apparition. He was informed that they had frequently
seen the rider, accompanied by a pack of
hounds, which hunted at full cry, but never did any
harm.</p>

<p>Dan gives Pierre Matthieu's version of the story and
adds, "I know what several authors narrate concerning
the hunt of Saint Hubert, which they declare is heard in
various parts of the forest. Nor do I ignore what they
say of the spectre called the 'Whipper,' which was supposed
to appear in the time of Charles IX in the forest
of Lyons, and which left the mark of the lash on several
people. Nor do I doubt that demons may wander in
the forest as well as in the air. But I know well as
regards the 'Grand Veneur' nothing is certain, least of
all the circumstances in which, according to the reports
of the authors, this phantom appears, and the words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
which he makes use."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The spectre huntsman chasing the wild doe and the
headless hounds in full cry are amongst the many prominent
demon superstitions still extant and the chief
legends concerning them, with their variants, are mentioned
by Charles Hardwick in "Traditions, Superstitions,
and Folk-lore."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The appearance of these and
other animal spectres, however, has never been satisfactorily
explained, and the question that naturally occurs
to the student after reading such stories is whether
animals are able to send forth astral or phantasmal
doubles in a manner similar to that in which it is believed
human beings can project them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<br />
THE PHANTASMAL DOUBLE</h3>


<p>According to Adolphe d'Assier, member of the Bordeaux
Academy of Sciences, there is no doubt that the existence
of the personality in animals as a separate appearance
is established, and as it is a replica of the external form
of the animal, he regards it as a living and phantasmal
image.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> He cites the following stories in support of his
theory.</p>

<p>"Towards the end of 1869, finding myself at Bordeaux,
I met one evening a friend who was going to a magnetic
<i>séance</i>, and asked me to accompany him. I accepted his
invitation, desiring to see magnetism at close quarters.
The <i>séance</i> presented nothing remarkable. I was, however,
struck with one unexpected circumstance. Towards
the middle of the evening one of the persons
present, having noticed a spider on the floor, crushed
it with his foot.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' cried the medium at the same moment, 'I
see the spirit of the spider escaping.'</p>

<p>"In the language of mediums, as we know, the word
<i>spirit</i> designates that which I have called the posthumous
phantom.</p>

<p>"'What is the form of the spirit?' asked the hypnotiser.</p>

<p>"'It has the form of a spider,' answered the medium.'"</p>

<p>This little incident, which recalls the ghost of a flea
pictured by William Blake, the artist, and Dr. Reichenbach's
dying mouse, led d'Assier to study the question
of the duplication of personality among domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
animals. After some investigation he was sure that the
medium's vision of a spirit spider was the reality, and he
quotes other examples of phantasmal doubles.</p>

<p>On April 18th, 1705, M. Milanges de la Richardière,
son of an advocate to the Parliament of Paris, when
riding through Noisy-le-Grand, was surprised when his
horse came to a dead stop in the middle of the road. At
the same moment he saw a shepherd, of sinister countenance,
carrying a crook, and accompanied by two black
dogs with short ears. The man said, "Go home, sir.
Your horse will not go forward."</p>

<p>At first the rider laughed, and then finding he could
not make his horse advance an inch, he was forced to
return, against his will. Some days later he was taken ill,
and doctors were called in, who finding that his complaint
did not yield to ordinary remedies, began to talk of
sorcery. Young Milanges then confessed to his meeting
with the strange shepherd and his dogs, and a few days
later, to his surprise, when entering his own room, he
saw the shepherd sitting in an arm-chair, dressed as he
had seen him before, holding the crook still in his hand,
and with the two black dogs by his side. In his terror
the young man called for his servants, but they could
not see the phantom man and animals.</p>

<p>At about ten o'clock the same night, however, the
ghostly shepherd flung himself at the young man, who
drew a knife from his pocket and made five or six cuts at
his adversary's face.</p>

<p>A few days later the shepherd came to the house and
confessed that he was a sorcerer and had persecuted M.
Milanges. He had transported his double into the young
man's chamber, as well as the phantasmal doubles of his
black dogs.</p>

<p>The existence of the living phantom, thus being
proved to M. d'Assier's satisfaction, he conceives that a
posthumous phantom is merely the continuation, as it
were, of the living double. A story of such an animal
apparition was given to him by an educated and reliable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
farmer at St. Croix, Ariège.</p>

<p>"One of my comrades," said the farmer, "was returning
home at a late hour of the night. At some distance
from his house, which was situated on a lonely
farm, he saw an ass browsing in an oat-field by the side
of the road. Moved by a feeling of neighbourly interest,
natural among farmers, he intended to take the unprofitable
guest out of the field, and advanced to seize the ass
and lead it to his own stable so that its owner might
claim it. The animal allowed him to approach without
difficulty and to lead it away without resistance. But
at the very door of his stable the ass suddenly disappeared
out of his grasp, like a shadow vanishing. In a fright at
this uncanny incident, the farmer woke up his brother
to tell him what had occurred, and in the morning they
went to the oat-field, anxious to see whether much havoc
had been done to the crops, but could find no trace
of the oats having been touched or trampled upon."</p>

<p>The night was clear and there was no cloud in the sky.
The young man, when closely questioned, asserted again
and again that he had distinctly seen the ass vanish before
his eyes at the door of the stable.</p>

<p>D'Assier's explanation is that the animal's spectre,
originating on the same principle as the human spectre,
exhibits posthumous manifestations analogous to those
observed in the latter cases. The ass of St. Croix was
met with at night because, like the posthumous phantom
of a human being, he shuns daylight. "He is in an oat-field,
pasturing according to the instinctive habit of his
race, but in reality browses (as one would naturally infer)
but the phantom of grass or grain. He follows his leader
whilst they are upon the road, but refuses to enter the
stable, which is for him a prison, and vanishes in order
to escape it. Here we have the essential features of
posthumous manifestations: and if the young man had
inquired among his neighbours, he would have learned,
in all probability, that some time previously a beast of
burden had died and been buried on a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
farm."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>A similar story was told by a Customs officer, and is
equally authentic.</p>

<p>"One evening when I happened to be on guard, with
one of my comrades," said the officer, "we perceived not
far from the village where I lived, a mule which grazed
before us and seemed as though laden. Supposing that
he was carrying contraband goods, and that his master
had fled on seeing us, we ran after the animal. The
mule dashed into a meadow and after having made
different bolts to escape us, he entered the village, and
here we separated. Whilst my companion continued to
follow him, I took a cross road so as to head him off.
Seeing himself closely pressed, the animal quickened his
pace, and several of the inhabitants were awakened by
the noise of his hoofs clattering on the pavement. I got
in front of him to the crossing, at the end of the street,
through which he was fleeing, and at the moment when,
seeing him close to me, I put out my hand to seize his
halter, he disappeared like a shade, and I saw nothing
but my comrade, who was as amazed as myself."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that he hadn't turned aside into
another road?" asked d'Assier of the Customs officer
who told him the story.</p>

<p>"That would have been quite impossible: the place
where we were had no outlet, and the only way he could
get away was by passing over my body: and, besides,
the night was clear enough for us to see all his movements.
Next morning the inhabitants of the village were
cross-questioning each other about the racket they had
heard in the night."</p>

<p>"Like the ass of St. Croix," continues d'Assier, "and
like all posthumous phantoms, our mule shows himself at
night. He is met in a pasture all absorbed in his favourite
occupation, that is to say, browsing imaginary grass. As
soon as he finds himself tracked by the Customs officers
he takes flight, as though he were really carrying contraband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
goods in his panniers, and he vanishes when he
sees himself about to be captured&mdash;all things which
characterise the post-sepulchral Spectre."</p>

<p>"In certain cases, not yet well defined," adds the same
author,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> "our internal personality may, by reason of its
fluidic nature, take on animal forms. Hence, when one
is in the presence of the spectre of an animal, there is
some reason to apprehend that this may be a lycanthropic
manifestation of the human phantom, unless certain
particularities identify its true origin. But I have said
enough," he concludes, "to establish the existence of
the fluid form-personality in animals and to demonstrate
that the post-sepulchral humanity is but one
particular case of a more general law&mdash;that of posthumous
animality."</p>

<p>Another story of animal transformation is regarded by
d'Assier as being a case of lycanthropia.</p>

<p>Two brothers occupied a house at St. Lizier, one of
whom tells the story as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I lived at that time in one of those little houses that
you can see at the upper end of the town. I was about
twelve years old and my brother was about seventeen.
We slept together in a room to which we ascended by a
small staircase. One evening we had just gone to bed
when we heard someone ascending the steps. Then an
animal about the size of a calf appeared. As the window
had no blinds and the night was clear, it was easy for us
to make out the animal's shape. Frightened at the sight
of it, I clung to my brother, who at the first moment
seemed as frightened as myself. But, recovering from
his terror, he leaped out of bed, ran and caught up a
pitchfork which was in the corner of the room, and,
placing himself before the animal, said to it in a firm and
resolute voice:</p>

<p>"'If thou comest by permission of God, speak: if
from the devil, thou wilt have to deal with me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thus encountered, the animal wheeled swiftly
round, and in turning it struck the framework of my
bed with its tail. I then heard it descend the staircase
precipitately, but as soon as it arrived at the bottom it
disappeared and my brother, who was close behind it,
was unable to see where it went. It is unnecessary to
add that the door of the house was fast shut. As soon as
I heard it descend the stairs I took courage and as the
window of our room was over the street door I opened
it to watch the strange visitor go out, but I saw nothing.
My brother and I thought we had seen a wer-wolf and
we accused an inhabitant of the vicinity, to whom were
charged other adventures of this kind."</p>

<p>A more explicit case of lycanthropy occurred at Serisols,
in the Canton of St. Croix, about sixty years ago.</p>

<p>A miller called Bigot had a reputation for sorcery.
One day when his wife rose very early to go and wash
some linen not very far from the house, he tried to dissuade
her, repeating to her several times, "Do not go
there: you will be frightened."</p>

<p>"Why should I be frightened?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I tell you you will be frightened," repeated her
husband.</p>

<p>She did not take his threats seriously and went out in
spite of them.</p>

<p>Hardly had she taken her place at the washing-tub,
however, before she saw an animal moving here and there
in front of her. It was not yet daylight, and she could
not clearly make out its shape, but she thought it was a
kind of a dog. Annoyed by its restless movements and not
being able to scare it away, she threw her wooden
clothes-beater at it, and the tool hit the animal in the
eye. Immediately the creature disappeared and at the
same moment Bigot's children heard him utter a cry of
pain from his bed and shout out, "Ah! the wretch!
She has destroyed my eye." From that day he was blind
in one eye, so that undoubtedly this animal was not an
animal double, but the miller's double in animal form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>D'Assier describes an epidemic of "obsession," or
possession by demons, which occurred in 1857 at Morzine,
in Savoy, and lasted until 1863, many young women and
animals being attacked by a peculiar affliction. The
atmosphere of Morzine, he says, "was impregnated with
a foreign fluid (aura) since all that was required was to
give change of air to ensure escape from the clutches of
the disease. In certain families the domestic animals ate
nothing, or satisfied themselves by gnawing the wood of
their mangers; at other times it was the cows, goats, or
sheep which gave no more milk, and what little some
yielded was unfit for making into butter. These phenomena
especially showed themselves in families where there
were patients. Occasionally the sickness was transferred
from persons to animals, and vice versa. If a young girl
was relieved, a beast in the stable fell sick; and if the
latter was cured the young girl relapsed into her former
state. In face of such facts it was no longer possible to
talk about obsession. The pest bursting forth simultaneously
in houses and cattle-sheds, could only be
ascribed to a physical cause, and the disorders that it
provoked in persons attacked showed clearly that these
phenomena were due to an excess or a degeneration of
the mesmeric fluid...."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> As a remedy, d'Assier suggests
that "Obsession being an abnormal afflux of magnetic
fluid upon the nervous system of the patient, the
direct remedy is naturally the neutralisation of this fluid
by a current of cerebral ether turned in the opposite
direction and emanating from an energetic will."</p>

<p>Paracelsus, meaning probably much the same thing,
declared that the astral currents produced by the imagination
and will of man produced certain states in external
Nature. The vehicle through which the will acts for
effectuating good or evil he calls the living Mumia. The
Mumia of a thing is its life-principle, a vehicle containing
the essence of life. Exerting great power, it can be used
in witchcraft and sorcery. "Witches," he says in "De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Pestilitate," "may make a bargain with evil spirits, and
cause them to carry the Mumia to certain places where it
will come into contact with other people, without the
knowledge of the latter, and cause them harm." Thus
diseases are spread, milk spoilt and cattle infected, the
injured people not knowing the cause of the evils with
which they are afflicted.</p>

<p>A curious story of bewitched cattle and "blue milk"
is told by Franz Hartmann in his "Life of Paracelsus,"<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
in which a kind of animal demon appears to have "possessed"
the cattle.</p>

<p>At a farmhouse not far from Munich the milk turned
blue. It had been deposited in the usual place and
darkened gradually, appearing first a light blue, and
becoming of inky hue, while the layer of cream exhibited
zigzag lines and shortly the whole mass began to putrefy
and to emit a horrible smell. This occurred for many
days running, and the farmer began to despair, for he
could not discover the cause of the trouble. The stable
was thoroughly cleansed, the place where the milk was
kept was changed, a different food was given to the cattle,
and samples of the milk were sent to Munich to be examined
by chemists; the old milk-pots were replaced by
new ones, and so on, but nothing produced an improvement
in the existing state of affairs.</p>

<p>At last a Countess who resided in the neighbourhood
hearing about the matter, went to the farmhouse. She
took with her a clean new bottle, and filled it with the
milk as it came from the bewitched cows. She placed
the bottle in her own pantry, and from that day the
trouble at the farm ceased, but all the milk at her own
house turned blue.</p>

<p>This went on for three months, during which time
everything that could possibly be done was done to discover
the cause of the milk being in this condition. Then
an old lady who lived hundreds of miles off, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
appealed to, laid a spell by her own occult powers, writing
certain incantations on slips of paper which effected a
cure of the trouble. But before it ceased, a strange
thing happened. As one of the milkmaids was about to
enter the stable before daybreak, a huge black demon, in
animal form, rushed out of the half-opened door, knocked
the milk-pail and lantern out of her hands, and disappeared
before she could awaken the household. After
this all went well again. An apparition of this character
may be regarded as belonging to the familiars or
elementals rather than to the animal-ghosts.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<br />
ANIMAL ELEMENTALS</h3>


<p>Suggestion no doubt plays a large part in producing a
belief in the power to change form at will, and the
occult aspect of transformation is perhaps more interesting
than any other view of the subject. Incantations,
salves, herbs, drugs, perfumes, and other accessories of
ritual are merely employed to strengthen concentrative
force and to induce a suitable state of mind. In this sense
the highest scientific method of transformation is known
to the Yogi who, by performing <i>samyama</i> on the powers
of any animal, acquires those powers.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p><i>Samyama</i> is the technical name for three inseparable
processes taken collectively. The three processes are,
firstly, contemplation, or the fixing of the mind on something,
external or internal; secondly, the unity of the
mind with its absorption, in which the mind is conscious
only of itself and the object; and thirdly, trance, when
the mind is conscious only of the object, and as
though unconscious of itself. Trance proper is the forgetting
of all idea of the act, and, still more important,
the becoming of the object (such as the animal) thought
upon. Thus, the three stages, contemplation, absorption,
and trance, are in fact stages of contemplation, for the
thing thought upon, the thinker, and the instrument
(together with other things which are to be excluded),
are all present in the first; all except the last are present
in the second, and nothing but the object is present in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the third.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The Yogi believes that the mind can enter into another
body by relaxation of the cause of bondage, and by
knowledge of the method of passing. The bondage is
the mind's being bound to a particular body. The cause
of limiting the otherwise all-pervading mind to a particular
spot is <i>karma</i> or <i>dharma</i> and <i>adharma</i>, i.e. good or
bad deeds. When by constant <i>samyama</i> on these, the
effect of the cause is neutralised and the bonds of confinement
loosened, then the mind is free to enter any
dead or living organism and perform its functions
through it. But for this purpose a knowledge of effecting
this transfer is equally necessary....</p>

<p>We always think in relation to the ego within us, and
therefore in relation to the body. Even when we direct
our mind somewhere out of the body, it is still in relation
with the thinking self. When this relation is entirely
severed and the mind exists as it were spontaneously,
outside and independent of the body, the Yogi finds the
state of internal mind most favourable for passing from
one corporeal shape into another, for it is nothing more
than the <i>vrtti</i> (or soul) severed from the body that
travels from one place to another. The act of the mind
cognising objects, or technically speaking, taking the
shape of objects presented to it, is called <i>vrtti</i>, or transformation.
Those familiar with the so-called spirit-materialisations
will readily comprehend the somewhat
obscure sense of this aphorism.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Animal elementals or thought-forms were employed
by magicians in the remote ages, and believed to be
created entities which persisted throughout time and
might be sent forth, somewhat in the nature of a familiar,
to wreak harm on others. Such animal thought-forms
are regarded as natural or possible by many occultists
to-day and two modern stories exemplify this belief.</p>

<p>A certain Miss Carter went to have tea at a friend's
house where she met a lady whom she knew, a Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Thory, the sister of an eminent philosopher. Miss
Carter asked this lady whether she would be kind enough
to tell her fortune from the cards, but Miss Thory declined,
saying that she felt tired. Shortly afterwards
Miss Carter went away and, as soon as her back was
turned, Miss Thory said to her hostess, "My dear, don't
have much to do with that young lady, because she goes
about telling people that she is beloved by an archangel
who kisses her on the lips, but I have seen the creature
which hovers about her, and which she takes to be an
archangel, and it has the shape of a crocodile and is
trying to influence people through her. It is an evil
elemental."</p>

<p>The other story concerns two friends, Mrs. Harper
and Miss Sylvester, who, travelling together on the astral
plane, decided to visit the bottom of the sea. They
believed they arrived there and saw an enormous octopus
which was floating about amongst the wreckage on the
ocean bed. Miss Sylvester immediately made the protective
sign of the Pentacle and suffered no inconvenience,
but Mrs. Harper neglected to take this precaution
and the monstrous animal followed her about. They
did not mention these strange experiences to anyone,
and they were well-nigh forgotten when some time later
it happened that Miss Sylvester introduced Mrs. Harper
to one of her friends, a very well-known poet. Meeting
Miss Sylvester a few days afterwards, he said to her quite
frankly, "I suppose I ought not to say so to you, but I
did not much care for your friend, Mrs. Harper. The
night after you introduced me to her I could not sleep
and whenever I thought about her I was aware of some
elemental creature crawling beneath my bed. It had
the shape of an octopus with horrible tentacles!"</p>

<p>Phenomena of this character are explained by the
occultist as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The elemental essence which surrounds us is singularly
susceptible to the influence of human thought. The
action of the mere casual wandering thought upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
causes it to burst into a cloud of rapidly-moving, evanescent
forms. Thought, seizing upon the plastic essence,
moulds it instantly into a living being of appropriate
form&mdash;"a being which when once thus created is in no
way under the control of its creator, but lives out a life
of its own, the length of which is proportionate to the
intensity of the thought or wish which called it into
existence. It lasts, in fact, just as long as the thought-force
holds it together. Most people's thoughts are so
fleeting and indecisive that the elementals created by
them last only a few minutes or a few hours, but an
often repeated thought or an earnest wish will form an
elemental whose existence may extend to many days....
A man who frequently dwells upon one wish often forms
for himself an astral attendant, which, constantly fed by
fresh thought, may haunt him for years, ever gaining
more and more strength and influence over him...."</p>

<p>It is said that a magician who understands the subject
and knows what effect he is producing may acquire great
power along these lines and can call into existence
artificial elementals which, if he be not careful, escape
from his control and become wandering demons.</p>

<p>The magicians of Atlantis brought into being wonderful
speaking animals who had to be appeased by an offering
of blood lest they should awaken their masters and warn
them of impending destruction.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>An even more terrible, psychic animal-being is described
by occultists as the Dweller on the Threshold.
In answer to the question, What kind of an animal is a
human creature born soulless? Madame Blavatsky<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> explains
that "the future of the lower Manas is terrible,
and still more terrible to humanity than to the now
animal man. It sometimes happens that, after the
separation, the exhausted soul, now become supremely
animal, fades out in Kama Loka, as do all other animal
souls. But seeing that the more material is the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
mind, the longer it lasts, even in the intermediate stage,
it frequently happens that after the present life of the
soulless man is ended, he is again and again reincarnated
into new personalities, each one more abject than the
other. The impulse of <i>animal life</i> is too strong: it
cannot wear itself out in one or two lives only. In rarer
cases, however, when the lower Manas is doomed to
exhaust itself by starvation: when there is no longer
hope that even a remnant of a lower light will, owing
to favourable conditions&mdash;say, even a short period of
spiritual aspiration and repentance&mdash;attract back to
itself its Parent Ego, and Karma leads the Higher-Ego
back to new incarnations, then something far more dreadful
may happen. The Kama-Manasic spook may become
that which is called in Occultism, the 'Dweller on the
Threshold.'...</p>

<p>"Bereft of the guiding Principles, but strengthened
by the material elements, Kama-Manas, from being a
'derived light,' now becomes an independent entity,
and thus, suffering itself to sink lower and lower on the
animal plane, when the hour strikes for its earthly body
to die, one of two things happens; either Kama-Manas
is immediately reborn in Myalba, the state of Avitchi on
earth, or, if it becomes too strong in evil&mdash;'immortal in
Satan' is the occult expression&mdash;it is sometimes allowed,
for Karmic purposes, to remain in an active state of
Avitchi in the terrestrial Aura. Then through despair
and loss of all hope, it becomes like the mythical 'devil'
in its endless wickedness; it continues in its elements,
which are imbued through and through with the essence
of Matter; for evil is coevil with Matter rent asunder
from Spirit. And when its Higher-Ego has once more
reincarnated, evolving a new reflection, or Kama-Manas,
the doomed lower Ego, like a Frankenstein's monster,
will ever feel attracted to its Father who repudiates his
son, and will become a regular 'Dweller on the Threshold'
of terrestrial life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Concerning the evolution of man-animal and animal-man,
Madame Blavatsky<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> declares, "it is most important
to remember that the Egos of the Apes are entities compelled
by their Karma to incarnate in the animal forms,
which resulted from the bestiality of the <i>latest</i> Third and
the earliest Fourth Race men. They are entities who
had already reached the 'human stage' before this
Round. Consequently they form an exception to the
general rule. The numberless traditions about Satyrs
are no fables, but represent an extinct race of animal men.
The animal 'Eves' were their foremothers, and the
human 'Adams' their forefathers; <i>hence the Kabalistic
allegory of Lilith or Lilatu</i>, Adam's <i>first</i> wife, whom the
Talmud describes as a <i>charming</i> woman with <i>long wavy
hair</i>, i.e. a female hairy animal of a character now
unknown, still a female animal, who in the Kabalistic
and Talmudic allegories is called the female reflection of
Samael, Samael-Lilith, or man-animal united, a being
called <i>Hayo Bischat</i>, the Beast or Evil Beast (Zohar). It
is from this unnatural union that the present apes
descended. The latter are truly 'speechless men' and
will become speaking animals (or men of a lower order)
in the Fifth Round, while the adepts of a certain school
hope that some of the Egos of the apes of a higher intelligence
will reappear at the close of the Sixth-Root race.
What their form will be is of secondary consideration.
The form means nothing. Species and genera of the
flora, fauna, and the highest animal, its crown&mdash;man&mdash;change
and vary according to the environments and
climatic variations, not only with every Round, but
every Root-Race likewise, as well as after every geological
cataclysm that puts an end to, or produces a turning-point
in the latter. In the Sixth Root-Race the fossils
of the Orang, the Gorilla and the Chimpanzee will be
those of extinct quadrumanous mammals and new forms&mdash;though
fewer and ever wider apart as ages pass on
and the close of the Manvantara approaches&mdash;will develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
from the 'cast-off' types of the human races as
they revert once again to astral, out of the mire of
physical life. There were none before man and they
will be extinct before the Seventh Race develops. Karma
will lead on the monads of the unprogressed men of our
race and lodge them in the newly evolved human frames
of this physiologically regenerated baboon.</p>

<p>"This will take place, of course, millions of years hence.
But the picture of this cyclic procession of all that lives
and breathes now on earth, of each species in its turn, is
a true one, and needs no 'special creation' or miraculous
formation of man, beast or plant <i>ex nihilo</i>.</p>

<p>"This is how Occult Science explains the absence of
any link between ape and man and shows the former
evolving from the latter."</p>

<p>The Indians believe that sinners are reborn as animals.
"After having suffered the torments in the hells, the
evil-doers pass into animal bodies,"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and their classification
of such punishment has been carefully worked out.</p>

<p>Mortal sinners enter the bodies of worms or insects.
Minor offenders enter the bodies of birds. Criminals
in the fourth degree enter the bodies of the aquatic
animals. Those who have committed a crime effecting
loss of caste, enter the bodies of amphibious animals.
Those who have committed a crime degrading to a
mixed caste enter the bodies of deer. Those who have
committed a crime rendering them unworthy to receive
alms, enter the bodies of cattle. Those who have committed
one of the miscellaneous crimes enter the bodies
of miscellaneous wild carnivorous animals (such as
tigers).</p>

<p>A thief (of other property than gold) becomes a falcon.</p>

<p>One who has appropriated a broad passage, becomes a
serpent or other animal living in holes.</p>

<p>One who has stolen grain becomes a rat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>One who has stolen water becomes a water-fowl.</p>

<p>One who has stolen honey becomes a gad-fly.</p>

<p>One who has stolen milk becomes a crow.</p>

<p>One who has stolen juice (of the sugar-cane or other
plants) becomes a dog.</p>

<p>One who has stolen clarified butter becomes an
ichneumon.</p>

<p>One who has stolen meat becomes a vulture.</p>

<p>One who has stolen fat becomes a cormorant.</p>

<p>One who has stolen oil becomes a cockroach.</p>

<p>One who has stolen salt becomes a cricket.</p>

<p>One who has stolen sour milk becomes a crane.</p>

<p>One who has stolen silk becomes a partridge.</p>

<p>One who has stolen linen becomes a frog.</p>

<p>One who has stolen cotton cloth becomes a curlew.</p>

<p>One who has stolen a cow becomes an iguana.</p>

<p>One who has stolen sugar becomes a Valguda (kind of
bat).</p>

<p>One who has stolen perfumes becomes a musk-rat.</p>

<p>One who has stolen vegetables becomes a peacock.</p>

<p>One who has stolen prepared grain becomes a boar.</p>

<p>One who has stolen undressed grain becomes a porcupine.</p>

<p>One who has stolen fire becomes a crane.</p>

<p>One who has stolen household utensils becomes a wasp.</p>

<p>One who has stolen dyed cloth becomes a partridge.</p>

<p>One who has stolen an elephant becomes a tortoise.</p>

<p>One who has stolen a horse becomes a tiger.</p>

<p>One who has stolen fruit or blossoms becomes an ape.</p>

<p>One who has stolen a woman becomes a bear.</p>

<p>One who has stolen a vehicle becomes a camel.</p>

<p>One who has stolen cattle becomes a vulture.</p>

<p>He who has taken by force any property belonging to
another or eaten food not first presented to the gods,
inevitably enters the body of some beast.</p>

<p>Women who have committed similar thefts, receive
the same ignominious punishment: they become females
to those male animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>Then having undergone the torments inflicted in the
hells and having passed through the animal bodies the
sinners are born as human beings with marks indicating
their crime.</p>

<p>These transformations came about by the insistent
wickedness of human thoughts and deeds. Eliphas Levi
discusses the magic power of the spoken word in bringing
changes of shape to pass. "In the opinion of the vulgar,"
he says,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> "transformations and metamorphosis have ever
been the very essence of magic.... Magic really
changes the nature of things, or rather modifies their
appearances at pleasure, according to the strength of
the operator's will and the fascination of aspiring adepts.
Speech creates forms, and when a person reputed infallible
gives anything a name, he really transforms the
object into the substance which is signified by the name
that he gives it....</p>

<p>"The life of creatures is a progressive transformation,
having forms which may be determined and renewed,
preserved longer, or else destroyed sooner. If the motion
of metempsychosis were true, might we not say that
debauch, represented by Circe, changes men really and
materially into swine, for the chastisement of vices would
on this hypothesis be a lapse into those animal forms
which correspond to them? Now metempsychosis, which
has been frequently misunderstood, has a perfectly true
side. Animal forms communicate their sympathetic
imprints to the astral body of man and are soon reflected
on his features, according to the force of his habits. A
man of intelligent and passive mildness assumes the ways
and inert physiognomy of a sheep; in somnambulism,
however, it is no longer a person of sheep-like appearance
but a sheep itself that is seen, as the ecstatic and learned
Swedenborg experienced times out of number. Thus
we can really change men into animals&mdash;it is all a question
of will-power."</p>

<p>"The fatal ascendancy of one person over another is
the true rod of Circe," he continues. "Almost every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
human countenance bears some resemblance to an animal.
That is, it has the signature of a specialised instinct.
Now instincts are balanced by contrary instincts, and
dominated by others which are stronger. To govern
sheep, the dog evokes the fear of the wolf. If you are a
dog and would be loved by a pretty little cat, be metamorphosed
into a cat, and you will win her. But how is
the change to be accomplished? By observation,
imitation, and imagination.... By polarising one's
own animal light in equilibrated antagonism with an
opposite pole."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Paracelsus has written at length on the same aspect of
the subject. "Men have two spirits," he explains,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> "an
animal spirit and a human spirit in them. A man who
lives in his animal spirit is like an animal during life, and
will be an animal after death: but a man who lives in
his human spirit will remain human. Animals have consciousness
and reason, but they have no spiritual intelligence.
It is the presence of the latter that raises
man above the animal, and its absence makes an animal
of what once appeared to be a man. A man in whom
the animal reason alone is active is a lunatic, and his
character resembles that of some animal. One man
acts like a wolf, another like a dog, another like a hog, a
snake or a fox, etc. It is their animal principle that
makes them act as they do, and their animal principle
will perish like the animals themselves. But the human
reason is not of an animal nature, but comes from God,
and being a part of God, it is necessarily immortal."</p>

<p>"The animal soul of man is derived from the cosmic
animal elements," he writes elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> "and the animal
kingdom is therefore the father of the animal man. If
man is like his animal father, he resembles an animal;
if he is like the Divine Spirit that lives within his animal
elements, he is like a god. If his reason is absorbed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
his animal instincts, it becomes animal reason; if it rises
above his animal desires, it becomes angelic. If a man
eats the flesh of an animal, the animal flesh becomes
human flesh; if an animal eats human flesh, the latter
becomes animal flesh. A man whose human reason is
absorbed by his animal desires is an animal, and if
his animal reason becomes enlightened by wisdom he
becomes an angel.</p>

<p>"Animal man is the son of the animal elements out of
which his soul was born, and animals are the mirrors of
man. Whatever animal elements exist in the world exist
in the soul of man, and therefore the character of one
man may resemble that of a fox, a dog, a snake, a parrot,
etc. Man need not, therefore, be surprised that animals
have animal instincts that are so much like his own; it
might rather be surprising for the animals to see that
their son (animal man) resembles them so closely....</p>

<p>"A man who loves to lead an animal life is an animal
ruled by his interior animal heaven. The same stars
(qualities) that cause a wolf to murder, a dog to steal, a
cat to kill, a bird to sing, etc., make a man a singer, an
eater, a talker, a lover, a murderer, a robber, or a thief.
These are animal attributes and they die with the animal
elements to which they belong; but the divine principle
in man, which constitutes him a human being, comes
from God. Man should therefore live in harmony with
his divine parent, and not in the animal elements of his
soul."</p>

<p>The object of human life is therefore to realise that
one is not an animal, but a god-like being inhabiting a
human animal form. If man once realises what he
actually is, he will be able to use his divine powers and
be himself a creator of forms.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The same writer describes beings which are neither
animal nor man, but which have characteristics of both,
and which he calls Nature-spirits or Elementals. To
these he gives the names of the Gnomes, the Nymphs or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Undines, the Sylphs or Sylvestres, the Salamanders, the
Pigmies and the Sirens. He attributes to them curious
qualities and shapes. They can, for instance, pass through
matter, yet they are not spirits, rather occupying a place
"between men and spirits." They are not immortal,
and when they die they perish like animals. They have
only animal intellects and are incapable of spiritual
development. The Nymphs live in the element of water,
the Sylphs in that of the air, the Pigmies in the earth,
and the Salamanders in the fire. Each species moves
only in the element to which it belongs. To each elemental
being the element in which it lives is transparent,
invisible, and respirable. The Gnomes have no intercourse
with the Undines or Salamanders, nor the Sylvestres
with either. Animals receive their clothing from
Nature, but the spirits of Nature prepare it themselves.
The Elementals belonging to the element of water
resemble human beings of either sex; those of the air
are greater and stronger; the Salamanders are long,
lean and dry; the Pigmies are of the length of about
two spans, but they can extend or elongate their forms
until they appear like giants. The Elementals of air and
water, the Sylphs and Nymphs, are kindly disposed
towards man; the Salamanders cannot associate with
him on account of the fiery nature of the element wherein
they live, and the Pigmies are usually of a malicious
nature.</p>

<p>Men live in the exterior elements and the Elementals
live in the interior elements. They are sometimes seen
in various shapes. Salamanders have been seen in the
shapes of fiery balls, or tongues of fire running over the
fields or appearing in houses. Nymphs have been known
to adopt the human shape, clothing, and manner, and to
enter into a union with man. The Undines appear to
man but not man to them. They may meet him on the
physical plane, marry him and keep house with him and
the children will be human beings and not Undines,
because they receive a human soul from the man. If an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Undine becomes united to man she will thereby receive
the germ of immortality. As an Undine without her
union with man dies like an animal, likewise man is like
an animal if he severs his union with God. If any man
has a Nymph for a wife, let him take care not to offend
her while she is near the water, as in such case she might
return to her own element.</p>

<p>The Sirens are merely a kind of monstrous fish, and
are related to the Undines much as giant and dwarf
monsters are related to the Sylvestres and Gnomes. The
monsters have no spiritual souls and are comparable to
monkeys rather than to human beings.</p>

<p>Such creatures seem almost too elusive to be labelled
as human-animals, but the description given of them by
the great occultist at least opens the mind to the possibilities
of classifying beings not defined by material
limitations or by animal senses. Of this character are
the spirits or elementals called up in strange, and sometimes
even gruesome, animal form by magicians when at
work casting spells.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<br />
ANIMAL SPIRITS IN CEREMONIAL MAGIC</h3>


<p>To call up demons the magician takes certain steps by
which he puts himself into the right frame of mind, and
by which he also ensures means of protection against
harmful magical powers which he may bring into play.</p>

<p>He first draws a magical circle, of different character
according to the time of the year, the order of the spirits
desired, the day, the hour, and so forth. Three circles
about nine feet in diameter with the space of a hand's
breadth between them is one method, certain signs and
written particulars being made within each circle. It is
then necessary to bless and consecrate the work, and
after nine days' preparation, being provided with holy
water, perfumes, salves, and ointments, a fine white
linen garb of a certain shape; having drawn the pentacle
of Solomon upon parchment in which to bind unruly
evil spirits and having recited certain magical incantations,
exorcisms, and prayers, he is ready and prepared
for the appearance of the spirits he desires to consult for
purposes of obtaining knowledge on various things that
concern him and his destiny.</p>

<p>Books on ceremonial magic explain how it is possible
to call up demons in the shape of beasts. "According to
their various capacities in wickedness," says Reginald
Scott, "so these shapes are answerable after a magical
manner; resembling spiritually some horrid and ugly
monsters, as their conspiracies against the power of God
were high and monstrous, when they fell from heaven."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Devils that belong to the supreme hierarchy, when
they are called up by magicians, at first appear in the
form of lions, vomiting fire and roaring hideously about
the circle. Then they convert themselves into serpents,
monkeys, and other animals. After the conjuration is
repeated, they forsake these bestial shapes and gradually
become more and more human, appearing at last after
frequent repetition of ceremony, as men of gentle
countenance and behaviour.</p>

<p>Demons from the two next orders of the infernal
regions represent the beautiful colours of birds and
beasts as leopards, tigers, peacocks, and so forth. By
conjurations these also may be induced to take on human
shape. Some, however, can hardly be conjured to desert
their monstrous forms and continue to exhibit to the
exorcist a pair of crocodile jaws or a lion's paw "with
other dreadful menaces, enough to terrify any novice
from such damnable injunctions as the practice of magic."</p>

<p>Such devils as Astaroth, Lucifer, Bardon, and Pownok,
continues Scott, who incline men and instigate them to
pride and presumptuousness, have the shapes of horses,
lions, tigers, or wolves. Those that instigate lust and
covetousness appear in the form of hogs, serpents, and
other envious reptiles or beasts, such as dogs, cats, vultures
or snakes. Those who bend men's thoughts to
murder, have the shape of birds or beasts of prey. More
tolerable are those qualified to answer questions about
philosophy and religion when called up, they seem almost
human, but have crooked noses like mermaids or satyrs.
Such evil spirits as have a predilection towards inducing
mixed vices are not of distinct shape like one single beast,
but are compound monsters with serpent tails, four eyes,
many feet and horns and so on.</p>

<p>In Barrett's "Magus or Celestial Intelligencer,"<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> the
author gives the Key to Ceremonial Magic with Conjurations
for every day in the week&mdash;to be used in calling up
familiars and spirits. Many of these appear in animal
form, namely, as a cow, a small doe, a goose, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
others.</p>

<p>The familiar forms of the spirits of Mars, according to
Barrett,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> "appear in a tall body and choleric, having a
filthy countenance, of colour brown, swarthy, or red,
having horns like harts, and griffins' claws and bellowing
like wild bulls." Sometimes they take the shape of a
she-goat, a horse, or a stag. The spirits of Mercury are
more affable and human, though they cause horror and
fear to those that call them. Sometimes they appear as a
dog, a she-bear, or a magpie. When the familiar forms of
the spirits of Jupiter are called, there will appear about
the circle men who shall seem to be devoured by lions,
and the demons may take the shape of bulls, stags, or
peacocks. On Friday, for instance, the conjuration may
bring a camel, a dove, or a she-goat, on Saturday a hog, a
dragon, or an owl, but it must always be borne in mind
that apparitions in human shape exceed in authority and
power those that come as animals.</p>

<p>The raising of ghosts by fumes is discussed by Cornelius
Agrippa.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>"If Coriander, Smallage, henbane, and hemlock be made
a fume, spirits will presently come together, hence they
are called the spirit herbs. Also it is said that a fume
made of the root of herb sagapen with the juice of hemlock
and henbane, and the herb tapsus barbatus, red
sanders and black poppy makes spirits and strange shapes
appear.</p>

<p>"Moreover, it is said that by certain fumes certain
animals are gathered together, and put to flight, as
Pliny mentions concerning the stone Leparis, that with
the fumes thereof all beasts are called out; so the bones
in the upper part of the throat of a hart, being burnt,
gather all the serpents together, but the horn of the
hart being burnt doth with its fume chase them all away.
The same doth a fume of the feathers of peacocks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hags and goblins," says Agrippa, "inoffensive to
them that are good, but hurtful to the wicked, appear
sometimes in thinner bodies, another time in grosser, in
the shape of divers animals and monsters whose conditions
they had in their lifetime.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then divers forms and shapes of brute appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For he becomes a tiger, swine, and bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A scaly dragon and a lioness,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or doth from fire a dreadful noise express,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He doth transmute himself to divers looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To fire, wild beasts, and into running brooks.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"For the impure soul of man, who in this life contracted
too great a habit to its body, doth by a certain
inward affection of the elemental body frame another
body to itself of the vapours of the elements, refreshing
as it were from an easy matter as it were with a suck that
body which is continually vanishing...."</p>

<p>These souls sometimes do inhabit not these kind of
bodies only, but by a too great affection of flesh and blood
transmute themselves into other animals, and seize upon
the bodies of creeping things, and brutes, entering into
them what kind soever they be of, possessing them like
demons.</p>

<p>Such herbs as belladonna, aconite, parsley, poplar
leaves, and drugs like opium, hyoscyamine and other
ingredients, as the blood of the bat, were used among
other strange ingredients for making the ointments,
which were rubbed upon the skin until it reddened with
the friction. This had the effect of making the recipient
believe he was being transported through the air, and as
the ingredients mounted more and more to his brain, he
was filled with imaginary visions of lovely gardens, and
forests, banquets, music, and dancing, probably also less
pleasant ideas of devils and mocking ghoulish faces.</p>

<p>Perfumes too had strange effects in producing states of
exaltation or trance.</p>

<p>Mexican priests rubbed the body with a pomade or
salve to which they attributed magical virtues, and at
night they wandered in the forests without fear of wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
beasts, but not necessarily believing they had been transformed,
yet the idea of metamorphosis can surely be
regarded as a possible hypothesis when it is remembered
that Man's body is composed fundamentally of the same
substances as the bodies of animals, that the same
elements murmur in the waters, rush in the winds and
form the insensate soil of the earth, that the cells in the
human being are not essentially different in composition
or structure from the cells in the bodies of animals, that
all cells are formed primarily of protoplasm, a compound
of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, and that scientists have
already solved the problem of separating matter into
electrons, and of measuring vibrations even to the million
and trillion per infinitesimal division of time. Is it to
be wondered at that in investigating such theories strange
results have been obtained and curious sights and sounds
have been seen and heard by the student?</p>

<p>The Chaldeans, who were among the world's greatest
magicians, like the Egyptians, represented demons under
such monstrous forms, with combined human and animal
characteristics, that it was thought sufficient to show
them their own image to cause them to flee away in
alarm. One such specimen, for instance, had the body
of a dog, the feet of an eagle, the claws of a lion, the tail
of a scorpion, the head of a skeleton but half decayed,
and adorned with goats' horns and the eyes still remaining,
and four great expanded wings. Such hideous forms,
borrowed as they were from the most different animals
as well as from man, were thought to have the characteristic
features of the first rudimentary beings born in the
darkness of chaos. The magical documents of the day
throw light upon the interpretation of these uncanny
monsters. They undoubtedly were possessed of a talismanic
character and were intended to avert fatal influences,
on the principle that an image has the same
value as an incantation, and like it, acts in a direct manner
on wicked spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Winged bulls with human heads which flanked the
entrance gates to palaces were thought to be genii which
kept real guard for the whole time that their images
dwelt there without disturbance. Expressive of this was
the ancient inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquot" style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>May the guardian bull, the guardian genius, who
protects the strength of my throne, always preserve
my name in joy and honour until his feet move
themselves from their place.</p></blockquote>

<p>In one of the magnificent palaces at Nineveh enormous
figures are represented having the body of a man, the
head of a lion and the feet of an eagle. These were
arranged in groups of two figures fighting with daggers
and clubs. Sometimes the groups represent the struggle
of gods against malevolent spirits. Occasionally the gods
were depicted wrestling with one or many bulls or bull-headed
men whom they assail with swords. Demons of
this character, called Telal by the Accadians and Gallu
by the Assyrians were believed to be particularly harmful
to man. The following fragment of a conjuration applies
to a struggle of two persons combating two bulls, or
creatures which are half-men, half-bulls.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Telal, the bull which pierces, the very strong bull, the bull which passes through dwellings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(It is) the indomitable Telal, there are seven of them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They obey no commands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They devastate the country<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They know no order,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They watch men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They devour flesh; they make blood flow; they drink blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They injure the images of the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are the Telal which multiply hostile lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which feed on blood, which are immovable.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In ancient Egypt incantations and exorcisms were used
in order to protect the departing soul of man from
malevolent beasts and also to keep the body from becoming,
during its separation from the soul, the prey of
some wicked spirit which might enter, reanimate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
cause it to rise again in the form of a vampire.</p>

<p>The following formula has been translated by M.
Chabas:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="blockquot" style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>O sheep, son of a sheep! lamb, son of a sheep, that
suckest the milk of thy mother the sheep, do not
allow the deceased to be bitten by any serpent,
male or female, by any scorpion, by any reptile;
do not allow their venom to overpower his members.
May no deceased male or female penetrate
to him! May the shadow of no spirit haunt
him! May the mouth of the serpent have no
power over him! He, <i>he is the sheep</i>!</p>

<p>O thou which enterest, do not enter into any of the
members of the deceased! O thou which killest,
do not kill him with thyself! O thou which
entwinest, do not entwine thyself round him!</p></blockquote>

<p>In another incantation, which was directed against
various noxious animals, the man who wished to obtain
shelter from their attacks invoked the aid of a god, as
being himself a god.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come to me, O lord of Gods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive far from me the lions coming from the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crocodiles issuing from the river;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not wave thy tail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not work thy two arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not open thy mouth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stop crocodile Mako, Son of Set!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a third formula the enchanter entreats the support
of Isis and Nephthys</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In order that the jaws of the lions and hyænas may be sealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The head of all the animals with long tails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who eat flesh and drink blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they may fascinate (me)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lift up their hearing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold me in darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To render me invisible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instantly in the night!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These magical words did not communicate divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
virtue alone to man; animals could also participate in
them for the protection of man, as they caused an invincible
power to dwell in creatures, like, for instance, the
watch-dog, to increase his strength by enchantment, the
formula for which commences:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stand up! wicked dog!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come! that I may direct thee what to do to-day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wast fastened up, art thou not untied?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is Horus who has ordered thee to do this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May thy face be open to heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May thy jaw be pitiless!<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Through solemn incantations, through desire and by
will power it may thus be possible to strengthen animal-qualities
for purposes best known to those who employ
such means. A modern writer on occult matters explains
the existence of wer-wolves and vampires on some
such psychic basis.</p>

<p>"The popular legends about them," he says,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> "are probably
often considerably exaggerated, but there is nevertheless
a terribly serious substratum of truth beneath the
eerie stories which pass from mouth to mouth among the
peasantry of Central Europe.... All readers of Theosophical
literature are familiar with the idea that it is
possible for a man to live a life so absolutely degraded
and selfish, so utterly wicked and brutal, that the whole
of his lower Manas may become entirely unmeshed in
Kama, and finally separated from its spiritual source in
the higher Ego.... To attain the appalling pre-eminence
in evil which thus involves the entire loss of a
personality and the weakening of the developing individuality
behind, a man must stifle every gleam of
unselfishness or spirituality and must have absolutely no
redeeming points whatever. And when we remember
how often, even in the worst of villains there is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
found something not wholly bad, we shall realize that
the abandoned personalities must always be a very small
minority. Still comparatively few though they be, they
do exist and it is from their ranks that the still rarer
vampire is drawn...."</p>

<p>The wer-wolf, though equally horrible, is the product
of a somewhat different Karma, and indeed ought perhaps
to have found a place under the first instead of the second
division of the human inhabitants of Kâmalôka, since it
is always during a man's lifetime that he first manifests
under this form. It invariably implies some knowledge
of magical arts&mdash;sufficient at any rate to be able to project
the astral body. When a perfectly cruel and brutal
man does this, there are certain circumstances under
which the body may be seized upon by other astral
entities and materialised, not in the human form but
into that of some wild animal, usually the wolf; and in
that condition it will range the surrounding country
killing the animals and even human beings, thus satisfying
not only its own craving for blood, but that of the fiends
who drive it on. In this case, as so often with the ordinary
astral body, any wound inflicted upon the animal materialisation
will be reproduced upon the human physical body
by the extraordinary phenomenon of repercussion....</p>

<p>"The vast majority of animals have not as yet acquired
permanent individualisation and when one of them dies
the Monadic essence which has been manifesting through
it flows back again into the particular stratum from which
it came.... The Kamic aura of the animal forms itself
into a Kamarupa ... and the animal has a real existence
on the astral plane, the length of which, though never
great, varies according to the intelligence which it has
developed."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>There is, says J. C. Street in "The Hidden Way Across
the Threshold," an electro-magnetic invisible liquid in
which we all float like fish in water. We are living continually
immersed in this ethereal fluid, which is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
in motion in a whirling vibration. "A cat-like soul-force
can only find satisfaction in a cat-like body, a dog-like
soul-force in a dog-like body. In every case the soul-force,
or essence shadow, has a corresponding material
body. An ape soul-force could no more mould and clothe
itself in a human body than a mouse soul-force could do
the same with an elephant body,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> "yet the elements
that go to make up the human, animal, or floral envelopes
or bodies, are held in solution in the atmosphere, and can
<i>through a knowledge of the laws governing it</i>, be utilised
to construct instantaneously any of the multitudinous
forms that exist in Nature." Further than this it is impossible
at the present moment to explain or to grasp
this strange theory of transformation which has held a
place in human thought since the earliest times, as is
proved by the foregoing collection of traditional phenomena.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>No completely satisfactory explanation of the phenomena
with which this book deals has as yet been formulated,
but the elucidation of the problems of transformation,
collected from many sources, should be sought primarily
in the latent power innate in man which enables him
to exert or project thought-forces, but little understood
to-day, of which, however, hypnotism and suggestion
are the most familiar forms of manifestation. Such
power, acting upon the plastic mind-substance of the
spiritual world, may, as far as we know, produce forms,
animal or otherwise, in accordance with the desire (conscious
or subconscious) and the will of the projector.
To bring about his purpose and procure manifestation
he has to induce a suitable state of mind, and to this
end he employs ritual and accessories of various kinds.</p>

<p>To take a single illustrative case in point. The animal
masks used in Indian theatrical shows serve as a means of
suggestive illusion. In mystical shows anticipatory fear
is evoked by such means. Indians are easily brought to
a stage of inability to grasp the difference between the
real and the suggested wild beast. But Indians and other
primitive races are not the only ones to succumb to a
strong will bent on producing phenomena. These things
affect all kinds of people, even in the so-called higher
grades of civilisation, and the effect of auto-suggestion
is quite as curious as that of hypnotism. A case has
recently come under notice of a woman who acquired
the habit of going down on all fours and making a noise
of barking, firmly believing that she has been turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
into a dog. In how much is she removed from the
hyæna-woman of Abyssinia? The cure is much the
same, and is brought about by counter-suggestion in one
form or another. In such instances, of course, it is not
to be supposed that actual transformation has taken place,
but spectators may nevertheless be hypnotised into believing
what the victim believes. By some such means,
too, Nebuchadnezzar may have been made to think himself
a subject of boanthropy when "he was driven from
men and did eat grass as oxen," continuing this occupation
until his body was soaked with the dews of heaven,
till his hair had grown like eagles' feathers and his nails
like birds' claws.</p>

<p>What difference is there between such a belief and that
of the spectator who thinks he sees the devil depart
from a woman possessed in the shape of a huge black
slug? He also may have been influenced by concentrated
thought on the subject, and the question arises
how far can human credulity be worked upon by the
almost limitless and as yet little-understood power of
the human mind. Much depends on the nature of the
individual, the environment, and the receptivity to the
kind of pressure brought to bear. Love of mystery
and awe of the unknown are also strong factors in
establishing faith, the first principle necessary for producing
creative power. Even the wildest superstition
enshrines something of reality and a stratum of truth
underlies most widespread beliefs.</p>

<p>Research on these psychical subjects should be carried
on earnestly and with untiring patience, always with a
view to eliminate the false and preserve the true, wherever
possible transmuting apparently evil elements and bringing
forth the fundamental good. Such methods should
make the prospects of discovering scientific facts more
and more favourable in the future.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a miscellaneous study of "isms" and
"ogonies" is often unproductive. Byron described the
state of mind induced by ill-judged efforts in this direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
in "Don Juan," Canto IX, 20:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! ye immortal gods! What is Theogony?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! thou, too, mortal man! What is philanthropy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! World, which was and is, what is cosmogony?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some people have accused me of misanthropy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I know no more than the mahogany<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That forms this desk, of what they mean,&mdash;Lycanthropy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I comprehend, for without transformation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men become wolves on any slight occasion.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The seeker after the facts about animal-metamorphosis,
confused by many undigested propositions, might
thus also attempt to salve his conscience, for man is

help to elucidate the problem with which they deal, they
will have served their purpose in pushing a step or two
through the darkness which shrouds so many secrets of
Nature.</p>
